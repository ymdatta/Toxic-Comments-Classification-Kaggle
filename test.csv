I'm assuming that this article is in the pseudoscience category because of its association with creationism.  However, there are modern, scientifically-accepted variants of catastrophism that have nothing to do with creationism — and they're even mentioned in the article!  I think the connection to pseudoscience needs to be clarified, or the article made more general and less creationism-specific and the category tag removed entirely."

 Unauthorised change 

On 26 January 2014 (i.e. just in the last few weeks), User:Mzilikazi1939 changed this article from the standard form of writing dates in the English language to CE/BCE. As he well knows, this violates WP:MOS, specifically WP:ERA, which requires that any change to an article's date style first be discussed on the talk page and justified with article-specific reasons before consensus is established and the article is then ready to be changed. As is clearly evident to everyone, none of these steps have taken place in this case.

Instead, in the two and fro of the last few weeks as Aesop has gone back and forth between the Queen's English and CE/BCE, Mzilikazi and his friends have claimed that the comments much further up this talk page and dated 20 months ago constitute the necessary discussion and consensus for the change of 26/01/14. Apart from the obvious fact that the article remained in the standard English state for 20 months continuously (May 2012 to January 2014), those comments were never enough to justify the change to CE/BCE even back then. This is of course because, as mentioned earlier, WP:ERA requires that article-specific reasons be given and consensus established. Neither occured then. What we see from 2012 can at best be called a disgrace; it was merely Dougweller and his friends making the laughably fallacious and tendentious claim that because there were more of them, they should automatically get their way without having to justify their case or convince anyone of it. The """"discussion"""" went quiet in its unresolved state and the change from the Queen's English (which the article has used since its creation and the overwhelming majority of the time since then) to CE/BCE therefore didn't proceed, at least until 20 months later when Mzilikazi decided to try again, this time without any attempt to follow the proper procedure.

If Mzilikazi and his friends want to legitimately change Aesop from the established English language abbreviations to CE/BCE then by all means discuss it here and follow the proper process. Stop trying to ram through your illegal change with constant back and forth editing. (  )"""

Advice
To save me writing too much, a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines - there is plenty of advice available, in fact a confusing amount, so pointers may be helpful. The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business' FAQ are particularly useful.

Wikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the Neutral Point of View which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). However, the anonymity of account names means it can't be prohibited, and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously.

It should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that won't get deleted, if you are careful. The first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion - be drily factual, as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it, but were documenting it for completeness. See the guideline on peacock terms.

The next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new - notability, which is the Wikipedia term for """"of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article"""". See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? It may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references.

I wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you have run into another problem - copyright. That's more of a problem than you might think, because everything in WP must released under the """"GFDL"""" which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use - so just saying """"I agree to this being put in"""" is not enough. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a last warning: an important difference between Wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article - see WP:OWN - other people can and will edit it. See the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""

Female masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.
Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.
Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and """"hump"""" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.

A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.
Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.
A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.
Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before """

You're right that speed cameras and lowered speed limits are an excellent way of taking the glamour out of motoring, and I fully support them for that reason despite the temporary rise in accidents that they cause.  In the long run, as people are made to use sustainable, safer transport, this policy will save far more lives than it costs, and so I can't see how anyone but the most militant, reckless petrolhead would oppose it.

I'm too busy to pool resources for the moment, but I will be adding some pages to my site in the near future about this important topic, and I will announce here when I have done so.

 Are you forgetting, Risker, that it was I that embraced Giano's plan to get Vk unblocked and presented it to the community? It was he and I that did most of the work drafting the conditions.

Vk (and Giano) were more than happy to have my input when he thought it would get him unblocked, but now the conditions are not to Vk's liking - despite what he agreed at the time - suddenly the accusations against me start again. What is really sad is that you seem to buy into it. 
I strongly resent your implication that I want him banned. I supported a ban in the past, true, along with many other editors.

 Singer List? 

Hi. I have an idea that would allow people to view various prospects for Scott Weilands replacement in an easier way rather than just posting sentences in the """"Split from Weiland"""" section... How about someone ends the """"Split..."""" section with a closing paragraph about Scott leaving and then they form a new section titled something like: """"Rumored replacement singers"""" or something like that.

It is easier to find names rather than searching through a section of the article that doesnt even have a title relevant to the fact that VR is looking for a new singer...

128206,"""== Perceptions of cuteness ==

I am ambivalent about the old meme reference in this section that the below poster complains about.  However, I do have a real criticism:

The line """"here are good evolutionary reasons to expect humans to find juvenile humans, and perhaps juvenile animals in general, cute."""" should definitly either expound on the alluded-to """"good reasons"""", or at the least link to somewhere in wikipedia where these reasons are enumerated and explained.

-B. McGrauw (not logged in)

I think the whole perceptions of cuteness section should be removed to improve the focus of the article. What things people find cute and possible reasons for that is an interesting question, but it is an anthropological question and serves only to muddle this article.

In any case, the """"Every time you masturbate..."""" joke should be removed. It was popular among internet humorists for a while, but not really worthy of note outside of its own article; also, it is an off color joke and goes completely against the tone of the rest of the article.

Any thoughts?
 
Hey.. i was looking for imformation on how to take care of abandoned kittens and came acrossed the discussion board.. i cant believe like a page was devoted to whether or not an article should linked on the page.. who really cares... i hope yas rnt losing sleep over it...(n)... i dunt mean to sound like a biotch... but its boring to read about all the complaints... and the point of the board is to write about cats/kittens.. atleast thats what the impression i got .. could b wrong though (anon)

The reference to the """"Every time you masturbate..."""" joke should be removed. It does nothing to enhance the article. And every time some kid looks up kitten on wikipedia, a parent has to answer questions about masturbation. It's offensive, if nothing else.  

In response to the first anon, this page is actually for discussion on how the article can be improved. Some off-topic comments are usually tolerated but long discussion threads are generally seen as disruptive.
In response to Wabazana, Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors. However, I do agree that this particular reference is a bit of a systemic bias towards nerdy references. I've boldly changed it to refer to Hello Kitty (which was already in 'see also'), which I think we can agree is going to be more familiar to the average reader.  

Lovely though it is, is """"perceptions of cuteness"""" really encyclopaedic?   
Well, it's interesting. It's written in a neutral point of view. And as regards verifiability, if 'kittens are cute' isn't common knowledge, then I don't know what is. So yes, I for one think it's encyclopaedic.  ( T | C | A ) 

I read about the '""""perceptions of cuteness"""" discussion on the wiki kitten page in the Wall Street Journal, Wed. August 15th edition, and was thrilled. The cuteness of kittens/cats is one of my favorite subjects, to the annoyance of everyone who knows me. I do agree with another poster's comment that the pics of the kittens on this page aren't necessarily the best. Feel free to use this picture of my kitten PJ.  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Pj_blinds.jpg
I believe when one sets his/her eyes on this image, there can be no question of the cuteness of kittens. Earnest t. bass is legendary and also a good example.  """

This is an oooold subject/section here, but I agree, the highly detailed diagram is quite scary-looking to a novice reader, and much more complicated than the basics of the topic.

The last disruptive revertion, besides be longer than the version I propose, was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as I shown above (again... See above points A to E in """"Once Again"""" section ) that were related only to the 2nd paragraph (of the version I propose);
and that
No word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph, as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph, that according to some editor (Ctr F on word """"solid"""" to see above, on the discussion about grammar in the """"Once Again"""" section), was """"pretty solid""""...

And even so, the revertion was done...

So, I again ask you all:

1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?

2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???

3) Which group of honest editors, ladies and gentlemen, who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?

Agreed. I amended the article after the chessbase article came out. I think it's only fair to report it, without endorsing or refuting the possibility that Topalov did, in fact, cheat.

It's frustrating and time consuming, arguing with characters like that. And while I had plenty of passive support last year, I'd appreciate some more active support for inclusion this time around, should Dionyseus choose to make another big stink. Apparently, Dionyseus interprets neutrality as the censorship of negative information, no matter how factual. Of course, this is the same guy who, last year, edited Kramnik's article so that it started with a list of his match losses. Of course, I wouldn't want to infringe upon wiki's tradition of love, charity, and respect; so, I feel I should clarify my position insofar as I absolutely DO NOT regard Dionyseus to be 1) a blight on wikipedia, 2) a mental degenerate, 3) incapable of lucid reasoning, or 4) incapable of language use.

Sinanoglu is not only a chemist, the """"moreover"""" and """"the"""" more important, he is the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""". The person who is subject of that article (Oktay Sinanoglu) published autobiographical book in 2001 in Turkey by using the fake titles of the “World’s Youngest Professor”, “Lord of U.S.A”, “at the peak point of science in U.S.A”, “The Turkish Einsten” etc. so he gained a lot of prestige in Turkey and a few million Turkish student accepted him as their idol and having been believed the fake titles of Sinanoglu are exactly true they occured the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement”. The last ten year (2001 – 2011) Sinanoglu became the “Hero of People” by using these fake titles that he published them in his bestseller autobiographical book. Today, by contributing a few million college student, the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” was like the superracist “Hitler Youth Movement” in Turkey and Sinanoglu became the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""" everywhere. By reading the autobiographical book of Sinanoglu, large amount of college students became “superracist Turks” under the influence of Sinanoglu’s megalomanic and fake titles. So, they are conducting the election campaign: “Sinanoglu must be the President of The Republic of Turkey!” Eight years ago, the first edition of this article was written by some members of “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” as the summary of Sinanoglu’s autobiographical book and this Wikipedia article was used by them in Turkey as the proof that the titles of Sinanoglu had been accepted as exactly true by whole world, so every Turk must believe that this titles of Sinanoglu was exactly true. That was the begining and the developing of the """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" in Turkey. Did you understand now why I was interested and why I am working to edit this article by using verifiable documents over 200 references? Please look at the edit history of the article. You will see a lot of vandal attacks to clean my editings. The last vandal attacks came from “Salvador21”-“Khazar2”-“Bobrayner” If you look at these users pages, you will see that these users are Turks and they are related with “Ottoman Empire” articles in wikipedia and they advocated “New-Ottomanist Imperialist Ideology” that Sinanoglu propagated this ideology in his autobiographic book. As a result, the some members of the superracist """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" cleaned the all words of the article which is writen by me and they provided to put blockage to my editings by showing themselves advocates of the Wikipedia Five Pillars. The “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” are in joy that Wikipedia blocked my editings. And now, they sing a song: “Long Live the Five Pillars of Wikipedia!

Addition of """"YLOD"""" has been discussed here in the past and the main reason it hasn't been included is that there weren't any reliable, notable sources discussing it.

I don't know if this is still the case but as far as I know, the problem hasn't been widely reports by the likes of Gamespot, 1UP, Gamasutra, etc. People have suggested that it should be included because RROD is mentioned on the Xbox articles and the response to that has been that while YLOD is known among PS3 users, it isn't nearly on the scale of RROD which was very widely reported on in both the gaming and mainstream media and it's notability has therefore not been so strongly established.

Unless the entire list or at least the tetrapod-like traits are reliably sourced (e.g. """"Smith (2001) lists these 11 traits as key tetrapod characteristics"""") the appearance is that you alone are advancing the view that all of these species and/or their traits are remarkable for their supposed tetrapod-like nature; assertions which may never have been explicitly made in reliable sources, and thus the list appears to be original synthesis.

 Clarification 

Posted from User talk:IZAK#Meshullam Gross  
Hi IZAK, thanks for that neat move of Nachlas Tzvi. Only two issues - one fairly significant.

1.If you want to be pedantic, he actually went by the English name of Herman Gross. Meshulam Tzvi was his Hebrew name and used in his Seforim.
2.Technically speaking and according to the information availible to me, he was NOT a Rabbi. Apparently (or so I've been told), he was offered Semicha many times and was certainly able, but never accepted it.
Therefore, I deliberately refrained from placing him in any Rabbi category, let alone the Haredi category. Off the point since he wasnt a Rabbi, I object to terming him """"Haredi"""" as the boundaries in his age were fluid and the word wasnt even used. Indeed, by todays standards he may not have been """"Haredi"""" (whatever that irksome term means). Many thanks,  """

Using the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota of 50, both parties reach quota, and there is a tie.

Using the Droop Quota of 51, neither party reaches the quota, but as they have the same number of first preference votes, neither can be eliminated; and we have a tie anyway.

Your actions in this case, and especially your tone in your edit summaries, seem to suggest that you feel you are in a position to dictate the methodologies of other editors with regard to work flow and communication, but in this case you have no policy argument to support this behaviour and no special position in the community entitling you to interfere in this manner, especially when you had no reason to believe the matter was not already dealt with to the satisfaction of the original parties involved.

67697,"Reply to FyzixFighter 

FyzixFighter, you are making some of the same mistakes as Brews. You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can't. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.

But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.

You seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.

The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.

When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.

It doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force."
99064,"""

 What is a """"scalar force""""?  

At the start of the current article there appears a list of pointers to other article, and the last item on the list says """"For the scalar force that appears in polar coordinates, see the article on polar coordinates"""". I checked the article on polar coordinates, and the word """"scalar"""" doesn't appear there. So, what exactly IS a """"scalar force""""? And why does the article point to another article for explanation of something that isn't even mentioned in the other article? Surely something is amiss.63.24.61.29  
Of course, you are correct in pointing out the absurdity of a """"scalar"""" force. This pointer should be removed altogether, but I have only edited it to remove the absurdity. The history of this article shows that this pointer was a concession to a long, drawn out battle that apparently exhausted all parties and led to this compromise.   
Any single dimension is a scalar- a scalar is simply a single number. There's nothing absurd about a scalar force any more than there is about a scalar acceleration. What is 9.81 m/s^2?- () WolfKeeper (Talk) 

I don't understand the """"corrected"""" version. The acceleration component that it refers to (i.e., the one that arises in stationary polar coordinates) is explicitly described and given the name """"centrifugal force"""" in countless reputable references, including:

(1) """"An Introduction to the Coriolis Force"""" By Henry M. Stommel, Dennis W. Moore, 1989 Columbia University Press. 
(2) """"Methods of Applied Mathematics"""" By Francis B. Hildebrand, 1992, Dover, p 156.
(3) """"Statistical Mechanics"""" By Donald Allan McQuarrie, 2000, University Science Books. 
(4) """"Essential Mathematical Methods for Physicists"""" By Hans-Jurgen Weber, George Brown Arfken, Academic Press, 2004, p 843.

 This has been pointed out previously, with the relevant quotations. I don't think there can be any dispute of the fact that this particular acceleration term is indeed among the terms that are called (in contemporary reputable sources) centrifugal force. Needless to say, it's entirely a matter of convention as to what names we give certain terms appearing in certain equations, but since Wikipedia articles are supposed to reflect verifiable facts from reputable sources, I can't see any justification for excluding this particular fact from the article. I think any discussion of the contemporary (let alone the historical) concept of centrifugal force is incomplete if it doesn't include this. 

There are also other concepts that go under the name """"centrifugal force"""" but that are not yet mentioned in this article. And conversely, there are lots of things discussed at length in this article that are only indirectly related to the concept of centrifugal force. I understand that much of this material has been added as part of a tutorial on general physics being given to placate some of the editors here, but ultimately I think it detracts from the readibility and relevance of the article. 

Overall I think the present article has evolved into a lengthy set of notes that various people have made as they clarified in their own minds certain aspects and implications of the centrifugal force, as they responded to challenges from certain other editors. Sort of learning on the job. That's a commendable exercise, but it doesn't make for a very coherent article, and frankly, the"

 Is everything kosher, and Sophia is ready to be WP:BOLD in mainspace now?  
 As I understand it, Phil her manager in the UK *is* still blocked, save from editing his own talkpage to discuss unblocking procedures. 
 Due to tech-related difficulties with inability to type colons (perhaps he edits from a tablet with no physical keyboard?), and because he did some impersonation of Sophia and some creation of new usernames for evasion-and-or-socking, Phil may need to wait for the Usual Six Months prior to requesting an unblock of his User:Welshmusiclover account, should he wish to return to wikipedia and get himself back into wikipedian-in-good-standing status.  
 I believe that Sophia can, if she so wishes, give Phil some pointers on the wiki-rules, and on the use of talkpages, and other such topics, which will immensely improve Phil's chances of getting his own username unblocked.  
 But they should both read WP:MEATPUPPET very carefully, so that they don't cross the wiki-rules against socking and puppetry and making edits on behalf of other people.  
 Sophia should exclusively use her own newly-cleansed user-account User:Sophia Giroux-Radisch, and not only should nobody else use it directly, nobody else should use it *indirectly* either.  
 On the other reason for her old user-account and Phil's current user-account being blocked, Sophia should be aware at all times that wikipedia is not a vehicle for self-promotion.  
 This includes herself, her albums, her movies, and so on, plus also her other clients and her co-workers at rock Solid Talent Entertainment (not to mention the corporate entity itself), as well as her relatives and friends.  
 She should remember the rules of WP:COI and WP:SPIP, and stick to making suggestions on the article-talkpages or in draftspace, if she ever wishes to see edits made, related to herself or her workplace.  
 Admins, is this advice all correct, and is there any other advice that Sophia needs to hear, before she goes on her merry way?

142303,"Network proxies are used for a number of reasons. There is the type that many organizations use to limit what their employees (or students, etc.) have access to, which is the reason you and your coworkers do not have access to Facebook or Gmail. They can also speed up access to websites and reduce the amount of internet traffic by caching or storing copies of pages that are frequently accessed. Normally, the proxy software is configured so that only users inside the network have access to it. In this case, however, it is misconfigured so that everyone inside and outside the network can access it. The effect is that anyone, anywhere in the world, can appear to be a user on your company's network. People often access this type or proxy for privacy reasons, but they are most often used as a gateway to send spam, to launch network attacks, to facilitate viruses and trojan horse attacks, and, sadly, to vandalize Wikipedia articles, which is the reason we automatically block them.

But to get back to your questions: I have no way of knowing when the IP address began acting as an open proxy, but it appears that it was detected and blocked by an automated process here on October 22, 2011. And, no, most organizations do not employ open proxies due to the security concerns I mentioned above. It appears that the IP address has not been included in any anti-spam blacklists yet, but if you run a Google search for it, you will see that there are some indications of trouble. Most network admins would be very glad to hear about this sort of issue before the IP address appears on blacklists gets blocked by their own or other internet providers.

Well, it does have some issues, so it seems.   First, I moved out one of the sentences that mentioned her ranking by NewsMax as a GOP figure.  I placed that to the other section about criticism and praise.  But, now there's just these two other sentences.   And they're really just dealing with her public appearances, which we've considered before… in fact, we eliminated them a while ago, if you see prior notes. See this Talk Page, where we mention that prior section once called """"Through all this time, Fiorina has appeared…""""  Remember that? We questioned the paragraph(s) and their citations and relevance.  Eventually it was eliminated. That's probably becasuse she's not unlike most public figures, that make many, many appearances through their lifetime.  That section has been gone a while now, seemingly without objection.  I'm guessing that's because most of us have agreed that we're not going to cite every appearance a public figure has made.  If its significant or exceptional, surely we can mention it.  But, now however, I'm wondering about a very short section that's currently titled Advocate at large.  That's since its become whittled down to two sentences, one of which is questionable.  I've actually found she may have appeared at Ripon several times.  But, to play devil's advocate… So what?  Republicans appear at crowds of conservative groups, Democrats before liberal groups, Greens before their own…. and so on.  Therefore, I question how exceptional this should be regarded.  By the way second sentence mentions """"National Press Club"""" as mentioned in the article.  But this Wikipedia article is attributing that to a Press club although it reads as """"National Press Club.""""  It's not particular to National Press Club (United States), which I'm not quick to assume, since the disambiguation the source (named in the citation) ambiguously calls it """"the National Press Club.""""  Again… appearing before THE National Press Club of the U.S. is not all that exceptional.  They invite notable dignitaries all the time… whoever, whatever party… etc.  Again, so what?   I wouldn't be surprised if The Club has invited most of the presidential candidates, if not had some of them speak in prior events, before they became candidates. So, I'm almost at the point of wanting to eliminate this entire section.  Any comments?   """

I see what you are saying but in my view Trinity and Aquinas are apart of each-other (hence why i reposted them). eg. AC is apart of TC because AC is TC's boarding school, and TC is a part of AC because TC is AC's Day School (if that makes sense). That was the idea when they made them, AC = boarders and TC = day kids. So in my view they are apart of each other? 

Maybe it is just the way I am looking at the topic at hand? im too 'personalised' with it?

Ok, So is it just my view of the topic OR am i completely screwed up on this entire thing.

But when converted to MJ/kg, the number is higher than gasoline.

Cristina,

Am I allowed to wish you a Happy Valentine's day, or is that verboten?!

Anyway, how are things? Have you moved into the new apartment yet? If not when? I'm really looking forward to paying you a visit and seeing it for myself - and of course you and Kerim! Don't forget when you are settled to send me some pics of the place.

You asked about Connie and Elvira. They are both well thanks. Tomorrow Connie will visit her parents for a couple of weeks to celebrate the New Year. It must be amazing to be in China for their New Year - it is such a big event. I know travelling and hotels in China at this time is a nightmare, but I still think it would be an unforgettable experience. Maybe next year..  Life in Peru is good; no news though. I'll phone Elvira this afternoon and then see her on messenger this evening after German. Are you and Kerim going to do anything special today? Romantic meal with wine and candles, followed by a quiet walk under a moonlit sky?! Or will he come home late from work, drunk and with lipstick on his collar?  ;-)

Is next Monday a bank holiday for you? It is here but I'm not too sure what to do. Claire has invited me to Lake Constance, something I need to think about. Or I could spend three days studying German -(  Blöödy German. If Europe wants one common currency, then why not also one common language? (Not French - Sorry Kerim!) To be honest I don't like my German lessons. The teaching format is, for me, very unconventional. There is very little reading and writing - almost nothing. Instead we are 'supposed' to learn through talking and repeating. While I know this will be perfect for some, not everyone can learn in this way. I sure you know the three ways people learn: aural, visual and kinestic. Well I know I'm a mixture of visual and kinestic. And when it comes to learning a language I have to see it written on paper, write it several times and actually use the words. Also she, the teacher, is not supposed to talk in English. Which begs the question how can she explain something complex without explaining to us in our own language. OK, enough moaning about German!

Thankfully I am not suffering from spending yesterday evening in the gym. I am hoping that I become addicted to the place and that I *have* to go to get my 'fix'. Tomorrow I have a fitness assessment which will be interesting. Next week will be the induction and I shall be given a program to follow. They also have lots of classes which is one of the reasons I chose to join this gym. Along with the muscle/fitness classes they also have more relaxing classes: yoga, pilates, etc. which I quite like. I find listening/understanding the class instructor hard enough in English, so to do it in German will be amusing! The gym I go to is in the centre but there is one closer to my home; not too sure how to get there though. Elvira wasn't pleased when I told her the showers and saunas are mixed! You know how jealous those latinas are ;-)

OK, time for me to leave you in peace. Please give my greetings to all and you take care. I shall be in touch again soon.

Besitos,
Dave"

 Promotional writing and non-free content 

The tone of this article is not factual and neutral, but comes across as a promotional brochure aimed at people who belong to to Lee's particular denomination or doctrine of Christianity. Cases in point: """"Lee knows that Christians lives are to be holy and should be empowered by the Holy Spirit"""",  """"Rev. Dr. Lee movingly testified to messages"""", """"...the fiery and explosive work of the Holy Spirit..."""", """"Blind eyes were opened to see and ears that could not hear came to hear"""" - those are a very few examples of utterly inappropriate and unencyclopedic phrases that abound in this text.  Add to this the fact that this article seems to make the claim that Lee can actually perform miracles of healing, in direct contravention of Wikipedia policies.  In addition, criticism and counter arguments have been removed or whitewashed, sometimes to the point of saying the exact opposite of what the sources state.

The article needs a lot of work by people who are not affiliated with Lee's organisation. At the moment, there are many editors who work only on articles connected to Lee and his work, and it seems probable that there is a strong conflict of interest here.

Another important issue is to do with non-free content. Bits of the promotional blurbs of Lee's books, and text taken straight from press releases, have been pasted into the article. It's difficult to find all the individual instances, because they crop up everywhere, and that's a very big problem. '''' contributions talk """

In Wikipedia film articles I've come across ridiculous, tiny detail by detail plot synopses from beginning right through to the very end. And, yes, that's 'allowable', but can be very annoying to many. The problem further is that then there may be no real in depth discussion of the film beyond giving the structure of the plot away, leaving a shallow, spoiling article.

So I was a bit relieved to find the current Norwegian Wood synopsis.  It doesn't seem to have been suggested much, though ideal would be for films to have a separate full plot Wikipedia page, containing the full synopses first also. It would leave it possible for people who haven't seen a film to read the main film article page without having to learn of what happens through to the end.

Anyway, ideally, I agree with 1ragincajun. Isn't it possible to be a bit more vague about the development, including something like - 'the hero's life develops with these 2 love interests in an emotionally tight film involving tragedy'? Just a thought."

The subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing. The subject of homophobia is (in short) the fear or hatred of gays, or discrimination or prejudice against them. The AFA is a recognized part of a body of groups, people, and ideas that define modern-day homophobia. There's no way you can deny that, even if you believe that the label is undeserved, that the label could be pejorative in a non-encyclopedic context, or that somehow being categorized under """"homophobia"""" and being an organization somehow equates to being categorized as """"homophobic organization."""" The categories """"homophobic organization"""" and """"homophobe"""" were deleted because they are, grammatically, constructed to specifically modify or describe the subject in question.

Miles have been spun about how much of a big deal this is, that we're gay activists, that we're creating attack articles, that the category homophobia is a pejorative attack on whatever it labels. Now, Sam, I know you'll insist on removing this part of my comment (editing/censoring others' comments is a practice that is, by the way, fairly dubious). But remember that we are supposed to discuss the issue at hand, not the character of others - I'm not attacking Hal's character. But his history of editing for the sake of the AFA is completely relevant to this discussion and a part of the issue at hand - it explains why he believes we've constructed an attack article (hardly), why the category is a pejorative attack or accusation (clearly not), and why it must be eventually removed. I agree with Hal: it could be taken as a pejorative, and what concerns me is that it is, but only (as far as I can tell) by someone who's made it clear that portraying the AFA in a positive light is very important (no matter [[WP:UNDUE|what that entails).

 Celine Dion Signings 

Please do not change Celine's signings in the infobox. The infobox should only pertain to signings and not imprints traced to the artist around the world. The reason why Celine was imprinted with Columbia and not Epic in Europe and Canada is because her catalog is actually sold by her original signee, Sony Music Canada, who uses the Columbia label. The content creator on the other hand is pic records up till 2007, and 2007 onward Columbia Records. Columbia Records as a standalone company exists in two places: NYC (original standalone company for many decades) and London (a division of Sony Music UK). Every other """"Sony Music (insert country name here)"""" company uses it as an A&R; imprint, they don't operate actual companies or standalone divisions called Columbia. Celine's first sony affiliate signing was in 1986 to CBS Records Canada, (CBS became Sony globally on jan 1, 1991), and Sony Music Canada used the Columbia logo on her (worked with the """"columbia"""" a&r; team at Sony Canada). Then Celine went on to sign with Sony affiliates in the US, but in the US they operate as standalone companies since there's many of them (there's just not one central """"sony music"""" company). However, even though she signed other sony deals in another country, her original signee (sony music canada) is still the worldwide sales agent of her work, and hence passed along their """"columbia"""" item to europe sony affiliates. Notice in the infobox it indicates she is still on sony music canada, because for as long as she's involved with sony in the US, she is still tied to sony canada. Furthermore, even without this explanation, it is irrelevant what label is used in other markets where the artist isn't signed for the infobox. For example, in Japan, Sony does NOT have the rights to the Columbia trademark, hence every single Sony artist ever, whether Columbia or any other label, was released there with the Epic imprint instead by Sony Music Japan. Does that mean we go to every sony related artist and insert Epic?? Indeed not. """

 Wikipedia Neutrality & This Biography Page 

I think it is fairly obvious by now, looking at the enormous amount of commentary over minutia detail over the last few weeks here on Deepak's page, that there is a handful group of editors posting and editing Deepak Chopra's biography here that belong to the Skeptics society and/or are well known Guerilla Skeptics (who have  published videos of their Guerilla tactics on Youtube).  I would not be surprised if some of them are getting well paid for their work.  Their willingness to go to any lengths to ban, harass, or IMO wear-out other contributing editors (who disagree with their view points) and willingness to use whatever tactics they can to promote their Skeptics society Point-of-View of credible scientists like Deepak or Rupert Sheldrake, or Frederic Myers, or Ian Stevenson or even William James, all of which the biographies here on Wikipedia have been modified in a very POV slanted manner (by many of these same small group of editors, sometimes in a very insidious labeling manner, such as calling Deepak Chopra a new-age Guru, or mentioning early on that Ian Stevenson was a """"gullible individual"""" etc.  I really do wonder how Wikipedia can continue to maintain there is any kind of veridical neutrality being practiced here?

I think it would be a good idea to bring in a whole new set of editors (or only allow a new set of editors) come in and rework some of the pages I have mentioned above, without the involvement of the Guerilla Skeptics here.  Perhaps a set of well-known editors that have established themselves on Wikipedia now for many years - could come in, and provide a fair and balanced approach to the biographies of Deepak Chopra, or Rupert Sheldrake, or Ian Stevenson etc.  None of which will be achieved IMO given the obvious agenda that has the foot prints - again of these few, extremely biased and active editors here. 159.118.158.122  """

 legends pertaining to Mucalinda 

I have heard and read from several sources a story which elaborates on the Mucalinda legend.  According to this story, the Buddha was pleased with his protector and blessed him by placing a hand on his hood.  As a sign of the Buddha's blessing, cobras bear his fingerprints on their hoods.  Indian or Spectacled cobras (Naja naja) of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood.  (These are thought to serve as """"eyes in the back of the head,"""" with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind).  This story may be told in Thailand also, although there is a slight inconsistency in that Thai cobras (Naja kaouthia) have only one spot. )

I have also heard a variant in which the Buddha was protected by the serpent not from rain storms but from the blazing Indian sun.

Unfortunately, I cannot find a decent source for either of these elements in the Mucalinda story and do not know where they originated. 174.111.242.35  """

Here is what great Hindu basher and pro-muslim and sikh historian cum writer Khushwant Singh writes-http://books.google.co.in/books?id=L5-oshsQ2cUC&pg;=PA37&dq;=koh-i-noor+kashmir+ranjit+singh&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=7EghT6iMIIvMrQfk7NivCA&ved;=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q;=koh-i-noor%20kashmir%20ranjit%20singh&f;=false

As you can see he wrote- the generals who led his armies in this campaign were all punjabis(he has written this intentionally to take credit away from punjabi hindu mohkam and misr chan); Mohkam Chand, diwan misr chand,fateh singh ahluwalia, hari singh nalwa and akali phoola singh what happened this represents the preference both hindu generals and then 3 sikh generals and ranjit singh trusted hindu more than khlasa or misl sikh generals.122.161.78.118  

Diwan Misr Chand given the title of """"FATEH-I-NUSRAT"""" by Maharaja Ranjit Singh when he put the SAFFRON flag on the top of Srinagar Fort. In short if you all khalistan minded sikhs though that why Ranjit Singh was so much inclined towards Hindus it because he knew his Empire belongs to HINDU(even though his empire has only 10% hindu, 80% muslims and 10% sikhs).122.161.78.118  """

Alan, I'm not sure what you think is compromised ... could you clarify? The core issue we are discussing relates to the template/contents of an Integral portal page that actually reflects the integral movement as it exists. AQAL is one author's (Ken Wilber's) name for his particular developmental model. It is already described in the wikipedia's Ken Wilber article and nobody has suggested that a separate page be added for it. The issue is whether thinkers who call themselves integral and are generally understood and acknowledged as """"integral thinkers"""", doing work that is called """"Integral Studies"""", can simply be identified in the Integral portal page as such, no matter what their particular sect or affinity, (which is all that I have suggested), or whether such thinkers need to be divided a priori into pro-Ken Wilber and anti-Ken Wilber camps, or """"Integral (AQAL)"""" and """"Integral"""", as it seems you may now be proposing. Obviously term AQAL (or even Wilberian for that matter) can be used inoccuously to describe Wilber's own writings. But how does a wikipedia editor decide that a work that calls itself integral (not AQAL) is not suitable for an integral portal page but only an AQAL portal? Even I did so once, as you noted. But it is quite another for a wikipedia editor to declare that certain thinkers or books cannot be linked or acknowledged at an integral portal but only an AQAL portal, based on some subjective interpretation of their use of elements of AQAL theories. I still do not see an answer for whether you would allow Robert Kegan into the integral portal or whether you would insist that he be listed under AQAL only, and I could ask the same question about dozens of writers who cite Wilber as one of many influences. Without a principled and objective answer, I think you are asking wikipedia editors to step into a totally untenable position. As I wrote earlier:
...usually thinkers use some aspect of Wilber's thought combined with the thought of many other sources, seldom use every feature of AQAL, and often disagree about key points. On what basis do you insist that people who call their thought integral actually be considered Wilberian? How much of Wilber's thought must one agree with to be so classified, and who decides? When you acknowledge that a thinker such as Robert Kegan has """"mutually influenced"""" Wilber and yet is part of the integral school of thought, would you propose to create a new Integral portal for such hard-to-classify thinkers, and segregate every thinker that displays too much affinity to Wilber or his model into a separate category, either explicitly called """"Integral theory (Wilberian)"""" or """"Integral theory"""" (but with the Wilberian association implicit, with a wikipedia editor such as yourself presumably determining whether every new thinker is sufficiently anti-Wilber to be listed in the main category)? 
I have not proposed that AQAL be used as a synonym for integral at all, only that any thinker who describes their work as integral and is generally acknowledged as such by independent sources be listed or linked at the integral portal in an appropriate fashion. Since, perhaps, some 90% of thinkers describing themselves as integral today are influenced to one degree or another by Wilber, the consequence of using the term integral in a neutral, objective way as I have proposed may very well be that many themes and ideas treated at the integral portal will be connected to AQAL in some fashion. Again, I will say that in my opinion the right place for your concern about AQAL being inappropriately used as a synonym for integral is in reviewing the content of the pages rather than in denying the usefulness of an integral portal at all.

62035,I don't understand post signing but I think note 117 ending the section on Justice Verma Commission is very misleading. The findings appear to have been completely sidelined as the women's groups in India maintain. The Finance Minister former Union Sec P Chidambaram openly stated that the cabinet cannot push through the reforms suggested by the Verma Report on AFSPA reform for example because the Army will not allow it. The rushed through new anti-rape ordinances ask for things not found in Verma. Simple directives for medical practitioners to stop the two finger test (it would be called finger fucking in the west but someone will object to the term not the procedure) and then call them forensic reports must be stopped as they are illegal.

How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? 

Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant """"to knock, as on a door"""" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like """"you're"""" and """"your"""", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier """"gay"""", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex """"gay anal sex"""", but that's really irrelevent. 

I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language.

Also, Tom.  Consensus was that the Beliefs section was for those beliefs that are generally Christian and not to discuss any differences, major or minor.  To break that consensus for any sect is POV if it is not done for any other sect of similar prominence.  I lost out on that consensus, but let us follow through then.

Here are some concerns that I found in the article on a quick run-through:
 resolved Please make sure that the discussion regarding naming is completed and the decision is finalized with consensus one way or the other before you nominate for GA status.
 There are two citation banners in the article, both for lack of inline citations, and both were placed there several months ago.
 resolved There are several sections in the article (Working, utility and assistance dogs, Show and sport (competition) dogs, Dangerous substances) that are composed almost completely of lists.  MOS discourages lists in articles, so these should be turned into prose as much as possible.
 There are a lot of short sections in the article.  For as many of these as possible, please either expand them or combine them with other sections.
 resolved There shouldn't be external links in the body of the article as there are at the end of the Ancestry and history of domestication section.  Instead, these should be turned into references, moved to the external links section, or removed altogether.
 The article needs quite a bit more referencing.  For example, in the Ancestry and history of domestication section, six out of seven paragraphs are completely unreferenced.
 Make sure that all of your web references have publishers and last access dates.  Also, please make sure that you are actually using the publisher, and not the work.  For example, with current ref #41 (The Case for Tail Docking), the publisher should be Council of Docked Breeds, not cdb.org.  
 resolved References that are in English do not need to be marked as such.  References that are in any language other than English do need to be marked.
 resolved Current ref #70 (Wolf at my door) deadlinks.
 resolved The Australian National Kennel Club external link deadlinks
I didn't go through the article line by line, so there are probably things that I missed.  The above are just fairly big issues that jumped out at me on a quick look through the article.  Also, I was recently involved in bringing Horse (another article about an animal with significant human interaction) to GA status...you may want to take a look there to pick up some ideas about layout, referencing, style, etc.  Drop me a note on my talk page if you have any questions, and good luck on your quest for GA.     —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  """

2249,"(The following is not a formal request to be unblocked)

Thank you AnthonyBradbury your comments made sense. The issues I raised relate to the ANI thread still remaining open. Both Erpert,  NEEnt, and now you as an administrator have said that the matter is 'closed.' 

Despite me being blocked 5 days ago and despite Erpert closing the thread and stating no further comments, another editor whatamidoing, removed that and continued making false, baseless claims, quoting inaccurate details, that easily be proved. Further, entirely separate matters, to what my block was for, are now being discussed 'after' I was blocked. Without me having an opportunity to present clear contrary evidence based purely on the objective editing history. And have a fair minded neutral and independent administrator to judge both sides. 

These editors knew there was a ANI thread, but did not comment for 2 days until I was blocked. After I was blocked they then and only then, stuck the boot in, without any facts to back up their false claims. They may have waited until I was blocked because these baselss claims would have been proven false immediately, through me providing diffs and objective facts to the contrary. In fact, they only ceased when I asked for a temporary unblock above to respond! They would have kept 'hammering away' with baseless false claims, providing no facts to back them up and all the while, me being unable to provide the facts. 

I have made some very solid edits to numerous articles. I respect Wikipedia. I respect Wikipedia's policies. I accept the reasons for my current block and would appreciate, after such a significant period, ie. 2 full weeks, to start afresh and be provided an assumption of good faith in my editing rather than editors judging me already. I think all editors, after being blocked should be given the benefit of the doubt. Not to have this thrown in their face for ever more. That's not right. 

I know a lot about some topics. Very little about other topics. My reliable sources have good. My editing and additions have been good. Productive in many different articles. I completely reject being 'incompetent' as whatamidoing states, without me being able to respond. Simply because of differing points of view. I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors. No-one is disputing that. They obviously gain a great deal of enjoyment from the project too! Does that provide these editors 'unequal' rights over less experienced editors who are also adding value to the project? Where they can make false baseless assumptions? I realise I have had some previous conflict with the same small group of editors in the past. But that says nothing about my edits being productive and of benefit to the project. 

I believe strongly in the principles of assuming good faith amongst editors. I did not think blocks were punitive whereby other editors can 'mock' the person who has been blocked? Nor are blocks an opportunity to make false, entirely baseless assumptions about an editor's competence. Is the ANI thread closed or is it not closed please AnthonyBradbury? I am hesitant to ask this through a formal request unblocking request. So could an administrator tell me if this ANI thread that was abruptly re-opened by whatamidoing, after the block was already applied, and the thread closed?"

One thing that is needful to attain NPOV is to avoid stereotypes. You've just created one (above) though I doubt that you did it intentionally, as some other editors regularly do. This is the portrayal of the opposition as judgemental, hellfire and brimstone types. This would be characteristic only of the most extreme fundamentalists (like Fred Phelps). It is not characteristic of the majority of conservative Christians; even a lot of fundamentalists would not agree, and are in opposition to those like Fred Phelps.
There are actually these extreme judgemental fundamentalists on both sides of the issue; only the guys in the white hats trade with the ones in the black hats. Witness the pro-homosexuals who use judgemental epithets (even on these talk pages) like bigot and homophobe. To get the page into NPOV we have to get past the stereotypes and the epithets.
A more typical conservative Christian view, and a more fair characterization, would be to think in terms of an owner's manual. If you drive your car disregarding the manufacturer's intructions; i.e. you abuse the car in various ways and don't perform the maintainence on the schedule that manufacturer gives, your car will suffer from it. It's not politically correct to mention, but it's simple and plain truth that homosexuals have shorter life expectancy; in fact promiscuity of whatever flavor will shorten a person's lifespan. You can develop the rest of this line of thought as well as I can. -And that is just physical health.
Because there is a strong pro-homosexual group of Wikipedia editors, who regularly communicate with each other (internal spam) the cluster of pages on the homosexual topics has deteriorated into propaganda pieces, that whitewash the dangers and risks, and paint the opposition in stereotypes/straw men that are easier to attack."

 Etymology 

The etymology section was completely wrong. The Hebrew consonant """"Tsade"""" results from the merging of (at least) two proto-Semitic consonants. They are still distinct in Classical Arabic, as """"Ṣad"""" and """"Ḍad"""". It is easy to see that """"chamets"""" corresponds to the Arabic root ḥ-m-ḍ, because the Aramaic version (which appears in the Aramaic parts of the Hagada) is ḥamiʕa (with `Ayin), and almost all Arabic """"Ḍads"""" map to `Ayin in Aramaic. In Hebrew, the root means both """"sour"""" and """"leavened"""" (cf. """"chamuts"""" =sour; """"chomets"""" =vinegar; """"chumtza"""" =acid). In Arabic it is used mostly to denote """"sour"""" or """"acidic"""". In any event, """"chamets"""" is not related to """"hummus"""" or """"Homs"""". """"Hummus"""" is """"chimtza"""" in Modern Hebrew, and in one case, """"chometz"""" in the Bible might be """"hummus"""" rather than vinegar, but the root is historically different, and only accidentally did they assume the same phonetic shape. 79.177.167.209  """

I am not misrepresenting any source by pointing out this well known fact amongst theologians. It may be so, that Sargis Bkheera did not teach Muhammad about everything, but Muhammad gleaned a lot from him.

Here's what AINA says:

633 A.D. (5383)
Muhammad declares himself the prophet of God and originates Islam. It is well known that Muhammad's principal teacher was the Assyrian monk Sargis Bkheera. This accounts for the extraordinary doctrinal similarity between some aspects of Islam and the Assyrian Church of the East. For example, according to Assyrian Church doctrine, there is no awareness of passage of time between the moment of death and final judgement; final judgement occurs immediately even though thousands of years may have passed on Earth. Islam holds this same view. It is also noteworthy that the Koran states that in the day of final judgement the angels of Allah will speak to man in Assyrian.http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/timeline.htm''

Where do you think Muhammad got that from? Of course, he got it from his Assyrian Christian teacher. You want this referenced from some academic work? I'm sure that's no problem.

I and I alone provided for mankind the most powerful machine since the dawn of time. I was foolish to think I'd get a meeting with the president or the Nobel peace prize. I guess I had my little finger cocked the wrong political way when I did it. Since this was known the forces that be have turned their evil cannons of jealousy toward me and ignored every rule in the book, played every unfair card in the book known and made as many unfair ones they could get their hands on to destroy me and steal it and gain credit for themselves on it. You have to decide if you are on the side of truth and life that I intended for this technology to bring or allow those lord high felons to destroy me with unfair and unequally applied rules. Are you going to be a part of that? Why do I say this? Because if I don't stand no honest person will forever thereafter. Have Wikipedia editors blocked William R. Buckley for the admitted first attack here and thereafter continual attacks, one short one and he's back at it,... or blocked SteveBaker for vandalism at all as he continues to do now and do as much damage to me he can? No. Or punished those dealing out blocks to me when they knew I did nothing for political bias? Did Wikipedia give me credit for my work and ban the copyright infringer and ultimate dark and threatening talker Freitas and Merkle  from this place NO! 

Wikipedia's rules clearly allow the publishing of lies from longer standing people of note, no mater how nefariously they slam the up and coming and tell lies far and wide and Wikipedia knowingly lets them. This is a media rag, period. Like any other. There are no real rules when they apply differently to one than another. Further, again, if you are being destroyed by unfair rules you have a Boston Tea party. Get it? It's called """"self defense"""" something you clearly do not understand. The only rule is a fair one and I don't see you or any other here trying to keep them fair in any way form of fashion you are just blowing political smoke. If you did we would not be here. I have not once been treated fairly and I don't see you doing it or anyone here that bothers to hang around here. You speak of rules, then block those that wrongly attacked me first before I even had a chance to play fair. Before I stuck my head out of the womb as a newbie around here. Don't walk away when I am being punished wrongly and you know it and above all don't drag my good name through the mud like a pig would do Mr. media guy. If you treat me fairly, you would be the first, from Larry King to Don and Mike to the Chief of police in Prince William County Virginia who had me arrested five times knowing I was innocent saying I was crazy for just talking about a self-replicator, even with my patent in my hand, gold seal and all (and you won't write of that here, not fairly). You want fair rules start making and enforcing them fairly and changing the unfair ones here starting here and now (but you wont). But most of all punish those who start the transgressions, not those fighting to defend themselves from the initial onslaught. And do not tell me you do not have special preferences around here.

I have contacted every lawyer on the list at the patent office and they will not sue a university professor (to answer you that question). Do me a fair article and you will never hear from me again because I am only here to fight a bad bio attack on me, that is all. I don't like Wikipedia because the rules are unfair here,woirse than any other media operation I've known.

93085,"WP:WEB

I don't know what you mean by jumping to conclusions, but noted nonetheless. To address your example directly, Dominic Deegan was actually printed, published, and released, which gives it a  bit of a foothold in the webcomic world. It has tens of thousands of Google hits, the first several hundred of which are unique and relevant, and several hundred unique sites also link to it. It also gets a couple million views per month according to Alexa.com. The three methods on their own are not always the best for rating the notability of a subject, but when combined, they give a clearer picture

Some articles are marked for deletion soon after creation, and others aren't marked until several months (or years) after their first edit. However, in the end, they will eventually receive the same scrutiny all other articles must undergo- an unencyclopedic article will not be allowed to exist on the premise that other unencyclopedic articles already exist; they will, in all likelihood, be deleted eventually as well.

As for WP:WEB itself: It's a guideline used to help determine the notability of the site. While the majority of sites that do not meet the criteria are deleted, all of those that do meet the criteria are kept. This criteria is an extension of the following policies:

 Wikipedia:Verifiability
 Wikipedia:Neutral point of view
 Wikipedia:No original research

The following guidelines:

 Wikipedia:Cite sources
 Wikipedia:Reliable sources

And the following tests:

 Wikipedia:Search engine test

Basically, if the site has independent material published about it, receives an award, or is distributed through a notable publisher, information about it can be verified and, most importantly, neutral. This avoids original research. This also allows us to cite reliable sources; Wikipedia is not a primary source or publisher of original research/information. WP:WEB is basically the condensed version of several other policies and guidelines aimed specficially towards websites."

Sources on Medieval Croatia

Early medieval Croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle: the more you study the less you know. When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia; but as I study more about Croatia, one by one """"facts"""" that I knew before turn out to be dubious, based on questionable sources or no sources at all. Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor; and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias.

Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later (seveneenth- and eigteenth-century) narrative histories. These were written by enthusiastic people but ciontain a mixture of fact and legend; and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost, it is extremely difficult to judge wheter their information came from reliable source or not.

 The Realm of St Stephen: A History of Medieval Hungary, 895-1526 by Pál Engel - 2005 I.B.Tauris edition, Translated by Tamas Palosfalvi

One of Ladislaus's most significant achievements was the occupation of Hungary's southern neighbour, Croatia. ... The small kngdom, born in the tenth century, streched from the Kapela mountains to the Adriatic sea, its center being Biograd, located on the coast.

...
King Demetrius Zvonimir, who, not being a member of the ruling dynasty, obtained his throne throug election, asked Pope Gregory VII fo a crown in 1075, and, in return, declared his kingdom as a papal fief. After his death, Ladislaus laid claim on his realm by the right of his sister, Zvonimir's widow, and had no difficulty in taking possession of Croatia in 1091. He bestowed the new kingdom, together with royal title, on his nephew, Almos, son of Geza I ...

I further entertained myself reading yet another great discoveries of contemporary Croatian historians (soc.culture.yugoslavia) ....

The exclusive revelation is the result of """"scientific"""" research by Croatian historian Dragutin Pavlicevic, and found its place in history books. The Split newspaper """"Feral Tribune"""" reveals that Pavlicevic authored a chapter entitled """"Croatian Indians"""", included in the second grade history textbook, shedding new light on the history of native Americans and their ties with Croats, """"one of the oldest nations in Europe"""". He affirms that in North Carolina """"a tribe has been living for more than 4 centuries differing in the color of skin, hair and facial features from other tribes"""". According to the same historian this is not surprising because the members of these tribe """"have the noble blood of ancient Croats from Dubrovnik in their veins"""". Mr. Pavlicevic also speaks about the Mateo Indians, named after their ancestor Mateo - a Croat named Mate. """"In his work, Dragutin Pavlicevic stresses that he estimates that presently there are more than 2 million Croatian descendants throughout the United States"""", states the Split newspaper.

The above statements about the essences of Nichiren Buddhism are which sects did what is a partial explanation; it is clear that it was composed respectfully by someone sympathetic to a particular sect, SGI.  SGI has a powerful voice around and world and has historically represented Nichiren Buddhism to important world leaders who sought it's understanding.  There are at least 2 other schools of Nichiren Buddhism: Nichiren Shu and Nichiren ShoShu.  These sects warn of SGI (but do not prohibit) it's practice; many feel that SGI inherently contains certain personality-cult rituals, and too frequently worship President Ikeda (the current leader of SGI) along with Nichiren and Shakyamuni Buddha.  Nichiren himself has said that he was not a Buddha, but an incarnation of Jogyo Bodhisattva.  The path of the Lotus Sutra is the path of the Bodhisattva  one who delays their own enlightenment until all other sentient beings in the universe have been saved from suffering.  Schools like Nichiren Shu do not believe that the priest should not be worshiped, nor the president, only the Dharma, the Wonderful Flower of the Lotus Teaching.  Several western nations have placed SGI on their respective """"Cult watch"""" lists, and in extreme cases family members have written letters to their governments for assistance in getting their relative de-brainwashed.

H_1 infinite means there's a non-separating surface; irrreduciblity means it can't be a sphere.  Compressing the surface gives a pi_1-injective surface, so the 3-manifold group contains a surface subgroup, which can't be the case if it's the integers (since the sphere is excluded).

Actually, the conclusion that the manifold fibers implies that the group contains a surface subgroup.  The surface can't be a sphere (because of irreducibility), so we have a more complicated surface whose fundamental group injects into the fundamental group of the 3-manifold."

Again, I never asserted the Greaseman's death.

Since Neturalhomer chooses to edit his User Talk page to erase the past, I will post the relevant exchange here (he gave """"removing vandalism"""" as the reason for editing it out; his only tool is a hammer, perhaps, so he sees me as a nail, perhaps)

Your Lie(s) About Me

You wrote: """"Final Warning

If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia, I will report you to AIV and to your ISP, Verizon. Stop now, this is your final warning. - NeutralHomer • Talk """"

Yes, I did use the language (on a talk page) and if it will make the booboo feel better, I apologize. But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve?

BUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair?

Let's look at your odd writing style: """"If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"""" Just what are you going for there?

I've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw.

Your threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away.

Now, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters.  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion.

Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system?

The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?

The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.

To recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.

Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?

Personal life

Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]

Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.

Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.

Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.

Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood"

I know W. Lloyd-Thomas and Clifford L.B. Hubbard did some of the older research on the corgi breeds (1930s).  W.

You are spot on Leladax. Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.

While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).

What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)

Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use

FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states

""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)

Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territory

Article 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.

""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.

If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.

The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) 

There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  

Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)
""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""

Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots. That one really made me cringe considering not so long ago everyone was being assured by FYROM leadership...

'""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.""""' Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first President)

'""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are a Slav people and our language is closely related to Bulgarian... There is some confusion about the identity of the people of our country""""'. Gyordan Veselinov  (Canadian ambassador to Canada in interview to Ottawa Citizen in 1999)

(incidentally both quotes appear extremely relevant to the article. I tried to add them myself to the article but they were removed without justification. You are welcome to try.)

 Only much later was it realized that the two processes [deformation and the creation of topography] were mostly not closely related, either in origin or in time. Very wrong. Deformation causes topography, and the generation of topography is synchronous with deformation.

As I mentioned above, there is no way for many of the exposed structures to get to the surface without large amounts of rock uplift and erosion. And as a matter of fact, the trajectory of different units of rock through an orogen is in part determined by patterns of surface erosion.

 Useful Links for Recycled Lumber   Nina

 Diminishing returns from recycling? 

I propose that Steven Landsburg's arguments be either removed or shown to be refuted by the below logic. I personally think that the argument below, no matter how logical, would be too large to include. Similarly, Landsburg's arguments are provably illogical, and should not be included.

""""Economist Steven Landsburg has claimed that paper recycling actually reduces tree populations. He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish the forests they own, large demands for paper lead to large forests. Conversely, reduced demand for paper leads to fewer """"farmed"""" forests.[34] Similar arguments were expressed in a 1995 article for The Free Market.[35]""""

If the variable of incentive to plant new trees is taken to be proportionate to the number of trees required for paper, as this scenario suggests, then the only way that the scenario is true is if it not only assumes that the paper companies are planting fewer trees than they cut, but that more trees are cut down than exist. 

The simplest refutation of the scenario is the model where lumber companies plant as many trees as they cut down. In this case, the number of trees not cut down, due to less paper being required, is immaterial, as the lumber companies would simply plant a number equal to what had been cut. In addition, more old trees would stand.

However, let us pursue the other, and in my opinion more likely, scenario. Companies cut down more trees than they plant. For the sake of simplicity, consider this hypothetical starting state. Forestry companies cut down half existing trees, and replant half of the difference between what stood and and what has been felled, or 25%, for a total of 75% of the original number, if not the original quality, the new trees being young growth. Let us say recycled paper amounts to one half of the trees cut, 12.5%, which would bring the total in terms of usable resource to 87.5%. If it were not added, the next cycle would see the 75% cut, literally, in half, for 37.5%; half is replanted, for a total of 56.25%. If it were added, the 87.5% would be halved to 43.75%, and the company replanting half of that would make a total of 65.625%, almost 10% more trees.

It does not matter whether the companies plant as many as were cut, if they are induced by the remaining forest amount, or a percentage, or induced by the paper supply, or a percentage; it always ends up with less forest cut down. If Landsburg is a notable economist, it speaks ill of economists; he has not exhibited logical reasoning or the capacity o"

Ok, first off, let me clarify that reverting is when you undo someone else's edit (yes, it does include the re-addition of material that has been removed by another user). Your use of the word """"vandalism"""" is incorrect in this case, because everything that you have been involved in so far is classified as a """"content dispute"""", since you and your opponents have been disputing whether certain text should be included. This is not a case of vandalism (this is, for example). Secondly, many of the users that you have been reverting or the ones that have been reverting you are on the same restrictions, so IMO now everyone is equal, and no one is """"winning"""" or """"losing"""". What I've tried to explain to you is that edit wars get nothing accomplished. You keep reverting and reverting, and then someone reverts you, and the cycle continues. Wikipedia articles aren't meant to go back-and-forth like that. The only real way you get something accomplished is by discussing it with other users, in the hopes that you can form a compromise, or consensus. To answer your numbered questions:
After we last spoke you continued to revert (, , , ). On Sason, you reverted 3 times in the last 24 hours. Even though you came close to breaking the three-revert rule (which you were blocked for on May 31), three reverts is not some sort of magic barrier that prevents you from being blocked. An admin could have easily blocked you for simply edit warring. This is the type of stuff that occurred on Armenian-Azeri pages for example before the arbitration case. After that many users were placed on editing restrictions, a lot of the problems were solved. Aggressive editing can be characterized as constant edit warring, and basically a method of getting your version of the article by constant reverting as opposed to discussion. Is is the exact opposite of what is outlined at WP:1RR. Even if you believe the information you are adding is NPOV, if it is contested by several users, the best thing is to discuss it with them, and once you have come to an agreement, to implement that version. 
I'm sure you've tried to be civil, but here I notice you referring to your opponents as """"vandals"""", this is inappropriate because as I explained above, you're involved in a content dispute here. If other users have personally attacked you, please show me links of this and I will warn them. It is never acceptable to do so.
Yes, it is possible. You can get mentored at Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User. Wiki-adoption was created back in 2006 as a program designed to help new and inexperienced users.
Although you may disagree with him, it is within Namsos' right to nominate an article for deletion if he believes it is non-notable. However, as you can see from the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Feigl, it appears that many users there are deciding to keep the article, so I'm not sure that it matters anyways. Everything that you mention (awards, documentaries, books, Google hits, etc.) can be mentioned at the AfD (articles for deletion page). I have noticed that you've already made a comment there already. Make sure to keep an eye on that page, the discussion is typically open for five days.
I don't know the specifics about why your sources were removed, but if you feel like you're not getting anywhere with these disputes, you might try posting something at the Reliable Sources noticeboard if there is a dispute on whether your sources are valid or not. Another option is the new Ethnic and cultural conflicts noticeboard. Finally, after you have made all attempts at resolving the conflict (including those two links I gave you), and you still feel like nothing has been accomplished, you can check out formal mediation. There, a mediator will get involved and act as a third party.
I hope all that I have said is helpful. Please feel free to drop a note on my talk page if you have any further questions/comments. khoi """

 2011 British GP team orders 

Before this turns into an edit conflict, what needs to be considered is that stating 'Vettel finished second after ...team orders...' incorrectly implies that he finished second because of those team orders. Since Webber himself admits that he ignored the team orders and still tried to overtake Vettel, IF it needs to be included, it needs to be reworded:
Although Vettel's KERS was malfunctioning at times, he was able to pass Massa on the track and took back second place. After a strong charge from Mark Webber towards the end, Webber was asked to """"maintain the gap"""" and not try to make a move on Vettel. Although Webber ignored his team's requests and tried to pass Vettel, Vettel was able to hold him off and finish second behind Alonso.http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/grand-prix-2011/frustrated-mark-webber-ignored-team-orders-in-vettel-chase/story-fn7r7gmb-1226092001816"""

According to The Undertaker's birth info on ancestry.com, """"William"""" is his middle name. Should this be added in the next edit?

 Correct me if I am wrong 
It says kennedy cost him 2 title shots
but didnt Batista cost the undertaker his title shot on the second one?

Yes and no, Kennedy attacked Batista, which led to Batista attacking Kennedy, thus in a manner, that was Kennedy costing Undertaker his second attempt at a title shot. ( )

Can sum1 add a trivia to undertaker saying that his world champonship win is his first title in 5 years upon winning the WWE championship in 2002

 Kane The Undertaker? 

Why is that under his nicknames in his stat box?

Because for a few weeks after he came to the WWF he was called Kane the Undertaker on WWF TV by Mooney and Okerland. That was the real name but it just got cut down to The Undertaker by the time Royal Rumble came arround.( )

Yea, I don't really get why the whole Kane thing is added either. I mean, it was something that wasn't aired and no one even knows about. The company doesn't even care about it as they never put it anywhere.  

He was announced at his TV debut as """"Kane, the Undertaker"""", as was just stated above, Twentyboy. And WWE doesn't talk about Katie Vick, so why should we talk about that, by your logic. - Hamlin 

His debut and first match (I think on Superstars) both listed him as """"Kane the Undertaker"""".

If you had any knowledge then you would read the article and u would see his debut and first match was at Survivor Series —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) .

Hr debuted as Cain The Undertaker and became the Undertaker after that. 

 Championships 

Undertaker did not win the WCW Tag Team Championships in WCW. He won them with Kane, while in WWE, during the Invasion angle, before the titles were unified. Stop adding it to a seperate section for a promotion his championship partner never wrestled for. - 

 Tag the Criticisums section 

I'v noticed that the Criticism section is quite biased toward The Undertaker. I don't knoow how to tag it for haveing disputed neutrality so can someone do that for me?-Terminator Storm

 undertaker/badass 
I think the half Undertaker/half Badass gimmick is ruining the Undertaker, not to mention the lack of appearances. Because he's sort of doing both, I don't think fans know whether to be scared or act like their at a roll'n roll'n concert. I liked him as the Undertaker, but that was back when I thought he was scary in the 90s. I don't have a problem with his badass side, btu I think he should stick to one or another because it's just confusing to me. Oh well, he's probably rich as it gets the way the company praises them like he's God so I suppose it doesn't really matter to him. I just have a problem getting the whole 90s Undertaker vibe when he pulls off his top and raises his arm, then pulls it back on and falls to one knee worshipping the urn and Paul bearer that aren't there. That's another thing, Paul Bearer with all the faces throughout the entrace, pulling off of the coat, using the power of the urn was a big part of that whole character. I think he should just give up on being the Undertaker because he isnt' scarying anyone anymore. That character was a good one that was meant to be scary, not changed into all sorts of rockers. I know you wrestling fans who are crazy about him are going to have a tizzy over my remarks. I'll just ignore them.  

This page is not for talking about the person/character, it is to discuss what should be done to the article. Also, ignoring critics is not the Wiki atitude. TL

 RfC: (Policy) Using bad practices from one article to justify another and possible sock puppetry; and (Politics) Acceptability of aggregated data in """"Election Results"""" section 

Policy
While not getting into the issue of reverting edits without first reaching out to the original editor to understand their motivation (in this case, the deletion of a table),  justifies the reversion of my deletion by pointing to other articles with the same flawed table...which he created!

Examples:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Papineau_%28electoral_district%29&diff;=prev&oldid;=654041277 - the above article
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottawa_South&diff;=prev&oldid;=593333525 - Ottawa South
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edmonton_Strathcona&diff;=636097681&oldid;=622403799 - Edmonton Strathcona

While we're on this topic, I found an identical table with identical formatting and citation in Toronto Centre...but added by !

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toronto_Centre&oldid;=670004225

This strikes me as possible sock puppetry.  I'm hoping a more sophisticated WP editor can either confirm or deny my hypothesis.

Earl Andrew already admitted to working as a polling firm employee in Ottawa. It seems likely the same user is responsible not only for adding the content cited, but actually generating it in meatspace.  This in itself wouldn't make the content non-NPOV, though one has to wonder why Earl Andrew guards Canadian electoral district pages so jealously (including the """"Political Geography"""" sections which he invented, the topic of our last edit war).  Articles about Canadian electoral districts are not Earl Andrew's soapbox and should not be treated as such.

Further, in the edit history of every single article mentioned above (only a handful, but statistically, that makes the following more damning), Earl Andrew and Fungus Guy are responsible for the lion's share of edits. While I understand that topics as specialized as Canadian politics may have only a handful of active editors, this appears to be a suspicious pattern and should be treated with all due seriousness.

Politics
's """"Redistributed results"""" tables and the identical table added by , are composed of data aggregated from Elections Canada results.  I take no issue with the data, but being aggregated, they are no longer results.  As such, they should at least be moved into a more relevant section with an explanation, if not removed altogether.  Putting the table in the """"Election results"""" section implies they are Elections Canada tallies, quite possibly having the effect of misinforming voters.  And we're right in the middle of an election campaign!

Unsorted
I could have done a lot more editing in the past 4+ years, but instead shied away from larger and more time-consuming edits and rewrites because I felt the end result might be another """"100,000 Edit Man"""" coming out of the woodwork to stifle me.  When more voluminous editors are allowed to browbeat others into submission because they generate a lot of """"content"""" or have a page full of barnstars, it necessarily degrades the quality of WP by reducing the number of editors.  It's hard enough to fight the paid corporate trolls on here, dammit!

It depends whether we want Wikipedia to be cutting-edge. It is clear to anyone studying Time Cube that Dr Ray's discovery of the Ineffable 4-Corner Truth renders him worthy of the positions of Greatest Thinker and Wisest Human; he is thus granted the authority to bestow a doctorate upon himself. The only reason not to recognise this doctorate is compliance with the general stupidity that has precluded rapid acceptance of Time Cube.

Well, I myself am not so keen on dumbing down Wikipedia for the stupid and closed-minded people; although some people do seem to be, as evidenced by the censorship of the following material:

In late 2004, and in the midst of a prolific period of Time Cube evaluation marked by his creation of new and inspirational Cubic scriptures, Dr Ray took the Cubic disproof of religious concepts to the next level, by solving the major philosophical question: """"Why something rather than nothing?"""" The answer, as published by him on his Time Cube website, related to the principle of opposites (in this case, static rather than dynamic/cyclical opposites), an important element of Cubic geometry: """"Between the opposites, all things are created. As an entity, they exist only as a big zero, seen from space as something and nothing from every possible view.""""

It appears that the religious zealots want there to be a lack of solution for """"Why something rather than nothing?"""", so that they can use it as a proselytisation/brainwashing tactic. Thus, when the solution is revealed, they cover it up as part of their efforts to prevent awareness of the Cubic Truth, which, as we know, disproves God and exposes religion as an evil Word-scam. 

It seems a pity, but in reality, great things don't come easy. We must all fight to break the Word-shackles of religious and Academic-induced 1-corner ignorance, and force teachers to teach Cubicism above evil cubelessness. Humanity's sole hope of salvation lies with 4-corner Cubic knowledge."""

The second is that translations are difficult and often there's a thin line between literal translations becoming unreadable to a modern reader, and interpretations that help with understanding the original texts.  There's many """"introductions"""" to Aristotle that make this point.  Aristotle in outline By Timothy A. Robinson or Aristotle By Christopher John Shields make similar points, as does A new Aristotle reader By Aristotle, J. L. Ackrill.  The Clarendon translations are often cited as being a set of references translations, translates the passage as """"In this sea are situated two very large islands, the so-called British Isles, Albion and lerne, which are greater than any which we have yet mentioned and lie beyond the land of the Celts"""".  Other translations are more literal - for example, early editions of Encyclopaedia Britannica state the following: """"The passage is in the De Mundo, c. 3,—"""" Beyond*the pillars of Hercules (Straits of Gibraltar) the ocean flows round the earth, and in it are two very large islands called British (BperaviKal Acyo/ievcu), Albion and Ierne, lying beyond the Keltoi.""""

79041,"That statement is the only thing I cannot believable about the Pirate Bay trial.  I hope they win the trial but there is no way they operate at a loss.  My friend operates a website that draws 500000 people per month on average.  With the same or less ad coverage as pirate bay, he earns 1 US dollar for every thousand visitors.  For pirate bay, this equates to 1 thousand dollars for every visitor they have.  They claim 25 million active members, so figure a lower number of 5-10 million per day.  This brings in as high as $10000 per day if I'm staying conservative.  This is not counting donations and likely better ad deals due to the large numbers of people being drawn and time of each person spent on the website (ie, multiple hits by a person per day).  So the amount of money being drawn in per day has a lower limit of 10 grand.  365 days in a year, unless these people are complete morons they should be bringing in at least a million per year gross income.  More likely several million.  With these numbers, if they only get a million hits per day, which is well within everyone's, including piratebay's, estimations, then they would still be making on the order of $365000 per year.  There is no way operational costs equal or exceed this value even if they bought brand new servers every other year, which doesn't seem logical given my knowledge of networking.
Now they might be incorporating expansion costs, ie the new server banks in Russia and other countries, and other related costs to expansion in costs of business when saying they operate at a loss.  Hate to break it to ya, this means they're just spending money they already earned.  So yes, they do in fact earn that much money, they just spend it as fast as they earn it.

Removing some wiki links from """"External Links"""" section (These links are irrelevant to post-disco): a Hi-NRG link and Italo Disco link. In fact, Post-disco influenced italo-disco in beginnings, but italo-disco is other class music. Taking it all, Italo-disco link you can find in infobox, in """"Derivative forms"""" segment.   

 Dance-rock redirection 

I change the dance-rock redirection, from dance music to  [[Post-disco#Dance-Rock]] . From actual-point-of-view , Dance-Rock can not have its own article, because of its sources. Dance-Rock's only source is All Music Guide, so there can be a WP:V problem. Anyway, Google finds """"nothing"""" (only just irrelevant pages), except.. yes AMG and Last.fm. However, some remarking have page of Billboard magazine from 2004.

I also created Dance-Rock redirect.   

AllMusic source
This article is one of a number of music genre articles that were created solely using AllMusic as a source, and for which few other sources seemed to be available. I'd rather have just deleted it, but decided instead to trim and rephrase it so that it was perfectly clear that elevating the term """"post-disco"""" to genre status was apparently an attempt to fill a gap in AllMusic's taxonomy of genres, and that it was the creation of a now-uncredited individual author who was paid to write it. Also I wanted to show the author never really defined it as a musical style; it wasn't ever established how it was related to disco on one end and house music on the other.

Recently the article has been expanded to cite other mentions of """"post-disco"""". I'm fine with that, but I'm not convinced every use of the term was really intended to be interpreted as a genre name. I'm just afraid this article is doing the exact same thing the AllMusic blurb did: trying too hard to give traction to a name for something that really didn't have a name, or that perhaps was only called """"boogie"""". I feel like I'd rather see a section of the Boogie article devoted to the dance music genre than to continue down the road of searching for vague references to dance music in the post-disco era as evidence of an accepted genre name. —  
My opinion is that post-disco is also genre (""""boogie""""), but also a movement, but that's WP:POV. I don't know.. I mean I don't understand what's really """"post-disco"""" (after disco era / boogie genre ?) means at all. If it is """"era"""" so all tracks to present is """"post-disco"""", but if it is a genre... (unsourced; only AMG and some kind of sites like """" danceclassics.net"""" etc).   

 OR & source misrepresentation in lead: analysis 

None of the cited sources other than Allmusic suggest that """"post-disco"""" is a genre. Many of the citations are also WP:SPS.

The term post-disco (or simply boogie) has multiple meanings. Citation does not support the assertion that """"post-disco"""" has multiple meanings or that it is a term interchangeable with Boogie

Sometime after 1990,AMG was founded in 1991 —  an Allmusic editorial contributor used """"post-disco"""" in an attempt to isolate a dance music genre in the era between the indistinct """"end"""" of disco music and the equally indistinct emergence of house music. Proposition unsupported by a third party verifiable source, this is editorial analysis therefore WP:OR

Text moved from article

 has been making extensive changes to the article.  Some of them changed clear and precise to less clear and precise language (such as """"implies that"""" to """"leads to the view that""""), some changed one stylistic approach to another, and some turned U.K. in to U.S. English, but the main section is this:

""""The second horn of the dilemma (known as divine command theory) runs into five main problems. First, it implies that the moral status of things is wildly contingent—if he had wanted to, God could have made rape, murder, and torture morally right. Secondly, it threatens the  normative force of the claim that God is good—it turns into the mere claim that God is consistent, or that God approves of himself. Thirdly, it commits the naturalistic fallacy; to analyze evaluative claims (e.g., that murder is wrong) in terms of what God has or hasn't said is to reduce evaluative claims to mere descriptions of God's activity. Fourthly, it seems to make morality subjective, with moral truths determined by the mere attitudes of an individual. Fifthly, it threatens the conception of God as a  rational being. For, supposing God had a reason for forbidding rape, this reason should also be the reason that rape is wrong. Otherwise, God's decision would have been based on the wrong reason. But if the reason rape is wrong is that God has forbidden it, then it can't be God's reason for forbidding it, on pains of circularity. So God's moral decisions were based either on the wrong reason, or on no reason at all.""""

Some of this can usefully added, but some isn't really acceptable: """"is wildly contingent"""" is not only unencyclopædic style, but is less clear than """"is arbitrary, based merely upon god's whim"""".  It also introduces technical terms where they're not needed (as does """"normative force"""" which, in addition, surely misses the target; it's not the normativity of """"god is good"""" that's at issue, but its status as a meaningful evaluation).  His or her fourth point isn't very commonly raised, and is surely implicit in the other points.  The final point contains material that could be made use of, but is in fact a discussion of the article's first point.   (Μελ Ετητης) """

I couldn't resist the opportunity to indulge a little. ) Here's the dilly (or part of it) on dopamine, melanin and Parkinson's. Dopamine and melanin have very similar structures, and dopamine metabolism produces a form of melanin called """"neuromelanin,"""" which is different from eumelanin, pheomelanin, et cetera, but still certainly a melanin. Neuromelanin gradually accumulates in the neurons of the substantia nigra throughout a person's life. Kids have very little, elderly people have lots. When people get Parkinson's they start losing their neuromelanin, and their SN goes pale. The fairly recently-published histology and pathology books I'm using just take it for granted that the loss of neuromelanin is basically a side-effect of dopamine depletion. But I may have been a little too confident in assuming that that's the final word. I just checked the National Library of Medicine website and a bunch of new research is turning up more immediate connections between neuromelanin and Parkinson's than had been suspected. Also, it looks like they're also getting promising results in studies on therapies that involve endocrine manipulation of neuromelanin. Still, all of this specifically involves neuromelanin in the dopaminergic neurons of the SN, and I haven't personally learned, heard or run across anything stating that there is any connection whatsoever between skin melanin and Parkinson's. But I guess the take home message for me is that there is more going on here than I realized, so I can't write off the possibility that there is alsothough I can't imagine howsome emerging connection between neuromelanin/Parkinson's and a person's skin melanin levels. Anyway, as you say, this article is about melanin generally, not just skin melanin in humans, so regardless the Parkinson's link is legit.  19:57, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Than in the protest section, rather than reporting the events objectively, quotes are used, not from people, but from pro-reformist articles, the result: """"Protesters in Tehran gathered  """"From Imam Hussain Square to Freedom Square"""", """"from east to west along Revolution Street"""", and it was on this day that """"the political and religious symbology of Iran's Islamic regime was turned on its head"""".[10] The protesters made another symbolic move- a """"symbolic journey from a square named after its most revered hero toward a monument dedicated to freedom, along a street called Revolution.""""[10]"""" is unbelievably POV, this should be immedietly changed to a proper written text which reports everything objectively. Meanwhile in the part about the demonstrations condemning the Ashura riots (which BTW, where much larger than the Ashura riots themselfes - a fact which was completely ignored by the writers of this wiki article), """"On December 30, counter-rallies staged and organized by the government at various cities, including Tehran, Qom, Arak, Shiraz and Isfahan called for the death of the protesters, with government workers receiving the day off work in order to attend the demonstrations"""" the sentence """"with government workers recieving the day off work in order to attend the demonstrations, was added in such POV manner and clearly to discredit those demonstrations.

Now although it is mentioned how rioters set fire cars, shops, banks and power stations (though other vandalism by the rioter isn't mentioned at all), this is such small part of the article. The violence by rioters (against people) is not mentioned at all, meanwhile there is a complete section devoted to alleged government violence against the protestors. The article is also clearly written with a goal of reporting only what is good for the green movement, this is illustrated not only by the POV quotes but by for isntance the way that whenever government claims are reported, they are immedietly rebuffed with other POV claims, leading me to believe they were only included to """"expose"""" the government as liars (which is POV). An example is """"Although official sources in Iran denied involvement of security forces in killing of protesters, at least one amateur video shows, the security truck which was deliberately running over the protesters.[16] Other evidence says that security forces were armed with guns and shot at protesters, including one amateur video showing a plainclothes security force directly shooting at protesters.[17],"""" with source 16 being non-existant and source 17 being a vehimently anti-Iranian blog showing a video of a gunman, of which there is no proof he is associated with the police of basij. In the article he is however labelled as a """"plainclothes security force."""" All in all, this article definetly needs to be re-written.  """

 Question for AGK 

Hi AGK. You mention above that arbcom is anxious for Nina to submit her evidence so that others can rebut it. Nina didn't open this case, LHvU did. He alleges that

""""...there is a sustained and possibly co-ordinated campaign to have the Wikipedia article reflect the POV of the """"anti-Stratfordians""""; providing potential authorship candidates (and one in particular presently) an enhanced (preferably equal) standing within the article to that of Shakespeare."""".

Why is the committee not anxious for LHvU to provide his evidence, so that whomever it is that he's accusing of engaging in this conspiracy can rebut his accusations?  Bishonen has called for Nina to be banned for at least a year. Why is the committee not anxious for her to provide her evidence so that Nina can rebut it?

 Section needs to be edited 

This line about New Hampshire is not very accurate:

On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Day was officially observed in all 50 states.[4] Prior to that New Hampshire and Arizona did not observe the day.

In fact, New Hampshire passed """"Civil Rights Day"""" in 1991, to honor Dr King, and other civil rights activists like Rosa Parks and Malcolm X.  Since the article states clearly that other states, such as Utah, have different names for the holiday, including combining it with Confederate military heroes, this sentence does not seem justifiable.  The article leaves the impression that New Hampshire was some sort of bigoted state, that was one of the last to recognize this holiday.

I assure I have no axe to grind on this subject. There may be ideas put forward through certain forms of creationism that I simply do not believe because it contradicts the available scientific evidence and I may find certain claims put forward as science exaggerated. It would not stop me reporting those beliefs if they represented a significant number of people or if they had a significant impact in a given society even though they were only held by a minority, albeit influential, section of the community. For example if a country has only small minority of people who believe in a literal six days account of creation yet they have an disproportionate influence on that society, for example in education, politics or the media, then I would cite the best available work(s) I know that support their idea but I would also put in the best arguments against them in a concise summary of the issue with links wherever possible to other articles that examine particular issues in more depth. I approach these kind of articles by imagining that I am an open minded reader who knows little about the subject but would like to see what the main issues are without anybody censoring or filtering out material they personally do not believe in. This imaginary reader likes to form his own opinions based on the best available information with a preference for top down structure in the article, i.e. general outlines of the issue followed by a more detailed exposition.

46507,"MSU Interview

Dear Samir,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar

During mating the male bites the female on the back of the neck, and it is noticeable that many cats will adopt a 'ready' posture, when not in heat or even male cats, when grasped by the scruff. 62.49.6.17  
I've added this, see Cat#Skin Think outside the box 

 Scientific classification 

It appears that the current use of F. silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy. I propose it is changed back to F. catus. First, this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion; most recently:
/Archive 8#Species name, and
/Archive 8#Scientific name
This discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity. It was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus, but no such citations were given. The article in its current state (under #Scientific classification) cites ICZN opinion 2027. However, as was noted in the prior discussion, this is a misinterpretation of the ruling, which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals; see this note, specifically reading from """"This erroneous nomenclature"""" and the preceding paragraphs. ITIS was also cited in discussion. This clearly prefers catus as the conventional name, although it cites MWS in noting that silvestris is also a synonym.

It would therefore be much more NPOV to acknowledge F. catus as the usual name. If catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under #Scientific classification. Currently, this section should have {{disputed-section|Scientific classification}} put on it, because its interpretation of the source is wrong. I would do this, but I'm a new user, so semi-protection is stopping me. It would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence; all the most cited, most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured F. catus.

Also, while this is still semi-protected, I'd like to point out that both inline citations of Mammal Species of the World should be removed. The first is uncalled for by WP:LEAD#Citations. The name """"cat"""" is common knowledge and is recognised by all 62 other references in the article body. The second deals with specific species names for cat breeds. MSW doesn't even mention these names, so it's unfair to synthesise from that that Wozencraft, let alone all feline biologists, does not support them. However, MSW is a useful reference, so I suggest moving the citation to external links, or a probably-needed """"Further reading"""" section.   
Works for me. My opinion last time was that we should go with whatever the reliable sources say and F. catus is now the accepted name, then so be it. ''''  {chat} 
MSW3 is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy. It uses Felis catus and notes there is some controversy. We should do the same. -  (talk) 
I view this with suspicion. If 's interpretation is true, then ITIS should not report the domestic dog as Canis lupus familiaris, and call Canis familiaris invalid. The ITIS webpage has no entry at all for Felis silvestris catus, not even to call it invalid. Felis silvestris catus is used more and more frequently in the scientific literature. I draw this from scholar.google.com: 
From 1982-1991, 0 uses of Felis silvestris catus, many uses of Felis silvestris f catus'' whatever that notation means.

Obviously Green Lantern or Robin are examples of a superhero name taken by several individuals, but the standard seems to be to create a 'main' article about the character name/legacy and give some details about each.  If more detail is needed/warrented, provide a link to the 'main article'.  Obviously this is also affected by the significance of the character.  Starman (comics) for instance gives descriptions of all of the many characters with that name, but only re-links to those individuals who have been notable using that psuedonym.  For Shadowhawk it seems as if the mantle of this character was passed cleanly from one person to another, so I'd say keep it all in one article as with articles such as Phantom Lady or Black Canary."

The citation you removed is the US Patent Office Database  there's no way to link directly to an individual patent there, which is the reason I cited the database and included information in the footnote about how to see the patent itself. Take a look at #138  it isn't issued to Colt, it has nothing to do with guns, and it was issued in the wrong year. Then take a look at X9430: for a revolver, issued to S. Colt on Feb. 25, 1836. (For both of those, you have to enter the number of the patent you want to see, then click the option to see images  there are no transcriptions, but they have scans of the original documents.)

The link I gave above  X-Patent  discusses the patents that were destroyed. Prior to 1837 (and the fire that destroyed the patent office's copies of those first patents) patents weren't numbered. After the fire, in 1837, the Patent Office started numbering all new patents, beginning at 1. They also started trying to recover extant copies of old patents, and numbering them as they found them, but beginning with X1. So pre-fire (1836 and earlier) patents are X-series, post-fire patents don't have the X. The patent Colt was issued in 1836 was an X-series patent, because it was issued before the fire. Anything without an 'X' can't be the right patent number for that date.

When sources conflict, we need to go with the primary sources above secondary sources. And the actual scans maintained by the Patent Office are about as primary as we can get on this issue."

I have added Telos to the home planet section of the infobox (mentioning that it was adopted) several times now and each it has been removed by the cryon user:Edoktor. Telos ought definitely to be included there as is is a massive part of who history, two episodes being set on telos itself and based around the cybermen's exploits there and at least 6 episodes featuring telosian Cybermen (the Cybermen in general featured in 10, so it was more than half. Many Cybermen were created there, there was a large cyberconversion facility, thus most Cybermen, after the tenth planet destroyed most of them, originated there and that is where the cyber controller rules from there.

As for the colour code, I advise you to read the entire conversation before going in to bold assumptions. Like I said in a previous post: """"Alright, this is getting out of control. You're getting this """"Yes/No template"""" thing all wrong, seriously. Someone at my talk page said the following: """"To use an extreme example: """"Does the console kill people?"""", the answer is """"No"""", which is a positive."""". So by your philosophy would you color it with green because it's a good thing? Wrong. No, consoles do not kill people and yes, it is POSITIVE, but this does not invalidate the fact that it still is something NEGATIVE related to the question. Even the the templates themselves have by default the green color for yes and the red color for no, and that must already  mean something by itself. The purpose of Wikipedia is objectivity, not subjectivity. But what the reader does with the information is entirely up to him. Which means that if he thinks that something positive/colored green is a negative thing for him, that's his problem. He can think whatever he wants of this information. I hope this clears things up."""". To sum it up: Yes=Affirmative=Green / No=Negative=Red, personal preferences don't come into account.

Konitski: 
According to the 1804 Code Napoléon in vigor at the time of Chopin's birth, Chopin was born a Frenchman - now, whether you want to interpret this as a French national or a French citizen, as far as I am concerned, c'est du pareil au même: he was a Frenchman.
Chopin began travelling outside of Poland - or should we say the Duchy of Warsaw? - in 1828: Berlin; 1829, Vienna, Prague, Dresden; 1830: Dresden, Prague, Vienna; 1831: Vienna, Stuttgart, Paris. In order to travel, he needed a passport and I assume (forgive me Widipedia for assuming) that he travelled on a Polish or Duchy of Warsaw passport.  No, I have no facsimile of it, nor have I ever seen any, but without passport, Chopin could not have left Poland. 
NOTE: In Selected Correspondence of Fryderik Chopin, collected & annotated by Bornislaw Edward Sydow, translated from Polish and other languages Chopin was using in his correspondence, by Arthur Hedley, McGraw-Hill, 1963, p. 90, from what is referred to as Chopin's Album:

One can't help speculating on how a clear understanding of the information contained here might have affected the Dayton Accord and history.
Publisher's Weekly, 4/20/98

By far the best available guide to the fatal steps to catastrophe.

There you have it. Noel Malcolm is revered and aknowledged as a neutral and impartial historian. But just because he isn't on of your Serbo-bloggers, you come up with all this shit about his works. When he says """"conquered"""", that is exactly what the term means. Your map is shit. Because Serbs ONLY MADE UP 25% of that land whether it was a bigger or smaller Kosova than today. And I call it KOSOVA because KOSOVA is it's name. It's Serbo-nationalists like you, Dab, and Balkanfever who keep it in it's Milosevic devized name. And you keep going on about the Treaty in London 1913. Well???? What happened???? Certainly nothing to do with Kosova joining Serbia because I said before and I'll say again - if it did, Malcolm would have said it. If he gets things wrong, why is he so well respected by all those reporters in the newspapers listed by Interestedinfairness. Answer that one. Dab, don't confuse the issue. It doesn't matter if Kosova was once it Italy, I tell you that it has never been in Serbia, it only had the bad luck to be in the same """"genocide state"""" as Serbia when a part of Yugoslavia. The end.   """

FUTON indeed.  I deprodded it because the cited city document spells out a series of reasons to consider the street notable. Confirming additional sources for those may take time and digging, but such sources seem quite likely to exist.  I note that a couple of Portland history websites provide promising avenues for research, for anyone able to take up the task.  If the quotes at Cafeunknown.com are accurate, the local papers made a succinct case for the notability of the 1925 lighting: """"From the standpoint of illumination per square foot, the Broadway association announces, Broadway will be the best lighted street in the world."""" (Sunday Oregonian, November 22, 1925.) """"Gay with iridescent brilliance of the Milky Way, the main boulevard of the City of Roses will burst Tuesday evening into a dazzling orgy of electric rays that will rival the most famous glittering thoroughfares in the world."""" (The Portland News, November 24, 1925.)  
And PDXHistory.com has an excellent page about Broadway, which perhaps ought to be listed as an external link here.   """

 Content Dispute 

I'm going to try and mediate the Iranian peoples dispute here could you please post your arguments there and we'll try and come to an reasonable comprimise   

1)Hi, History section needs clarification, while linguistically all of those people are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother, I am pointing to the last paragraph of the history section. It should be clarified. Thanks. Talk + 
 Modern Persians themselves are a diverse group of peoples descended from various Iranian and indigenous peoples of the Iranian plateau including the Elamites. Although all Persians are linguistically connected to each other ethnic backgrounds are diverse with many different cultural traits. 
Would something like that be preferable to you  

Yes, but the word Iranians instead of Persians. Persians are by themselves a member of that linguistic group. Talk + 
 Ok, I stand corrected (I'm not familiar with the topic matter at hand here, I'm googling trying to find information) - if nobody objects I propse changing the paragraph to the above, it seems clearer to me   

No sorry this paragraph: Thus, not unlike the previous example of Germanic peoples involving the English, who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin, Iranian is an ethno-linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and/or cultural traits that denote their respective identities.  Talk + 

Here I meant Iranian peoples linguistically are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother. so the claim refering to common ethnicity in the articler is not correct.
 Talk + 
 Ok, is Germanic peoples involving the English, who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin also an ethno-linguistic group? If so, should we add """"only"""" to Iranian is an ethno-linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and/or cultural traits that denote their respective identities
  

The Iranian people Unlike gernmanic people are from quite different etnicities like Turkic, Persian and others uncertain. The whole sentence is wrong and POV. we should drop the word common ethnicity and clarify that it is only a linguistic term'''. Talk + 

2)The info box does not belong here. Iranian peoples are not an ethnic group. They are several different ethnicities speaking different languages. It should be removed as in any other linguistic group. Talk + 
 I think you have a valid point there, I would like to see the argument to the contrary before making a recomendation though.

3)Aryan is a linguistic term that refers to an ancient language group that was ancestral to the Indo-European family of languages''. [http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring01/Millig"

I have been accused of sock puppeting, yet they still havnt brought one single piece of tangible proof, even though the other person claimed he was from mexico, which I am from the states. The main reason why I was initially blocked was because of Bigcat82, as his false accusations, bias moderating, lies, misinformation and more lies...7 different people have noted he was bias, and still he is allowed to control the lion vs tiger section with only repeating its not reliable or not a peer journal, none of this is true, for instance, his account where he put on lion vs tiger has been sitting there for going on 6 years and still no one has even peered into it, it is a straight up lie that he said the lion was killed, here is the full article of the 1909 fight:

[url]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NuqIbte0hB8/T8DE0k29m2I/AAAAAAAAyuI/uNemgrJ-vfI/s1600/Anotherfightatbostocks.jpg[/url]

Miss informs people, and twists facts, he uses this tactics on the roman accounts, leaving out who won in popmeii and following it in with a non credible source William bridges is not a historian, but he uses it to capitalize on the archaeology book, in fact that book roots to the fact the lion defeated the tiger, as roman/italian sites says the tiger is being attacked by a lion:
[url]http://www.romanoimpero.com/2010/01/pompei.html[/url]

He routes it to the usual that it was a leopard, but the leopard mosaic is in the house of doves, the lion standing over a prostrated tiger is in the house of faun. Several members point out his major flaws such as Bbbeto, as he states its not that the sources arnt reliable he just doesnt want anything that favors the lion and will show the lion as the usual winner, its not that they arent peer jorunals, its that the support the lion, he has erased over 20 things not seeable now on the talk page and edit page, it doesnt matter if its from a trainer, if they support the lion he will call it unreliable and the rules dont apply...what rules? Its only his rules, there hasnt been a consensus done by 10 people at once going on over 6 years? Is this what wiki is for, for who ever is the more persistent and the better liar to be able to control wiki? Its just his ) and he should be banned from editing that topic, since he is already a part of over 20 forums specifically on topic where he has been caught lying, for instance he just said he has graduated from 10 university's...
[url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BigCat82[/url]

Really he graduated from 10 of the top university around the world? Show us just one of them, name the university, show us who you studied under, show us a copy of your diploma, he is a pathological liar, look under the bear contributions countless of people call him specifically a tiger fan, look at the talk page there, the lion vs tiger contribution, only he is ever erasing things of favoring the lion, Wikipedia mods should be ashamed for having a person use its search engine for a person pumping out his own propaganda and bias POV for this amount of time unchecked. He now says that no experts favor a lion, really? Define expert, if we look at what wiki has as expert:
[url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert[/url]

We can see that an expert is someone who has pro-longed experience or observation, the topic is about them fighting, so they have to have excerpts and citations of them seeing a fight...no excerpts of them exist for the tiger so far, yet he disputes people who does, and is considered experts.

 The casual reader should receive the message that the expulsions were agreed to at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences.  They should also be aware that Stalin outmaneuvered the gullible Western Allies at both those conferences.  Stalin didn't care about the Poles (he killed 22,000 Poles, mostly Polish military officers, at Katyn in 1940); Stalin was more concerned about gaining back lands lost in the early 1920s, namely lands within the 1937 Polish border east of the Curzon Line.  That land area had a population which included 40% ethnic Poles.  Stalin needed somewhere to dump those Poles, so he proposed that Germans be moved west & the Poles be moved west.  Roosevelt was dying in 1945 - he was easily outmaneuvered by Stalin.  By the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945 Churchill had lost power and had to leave the conference early, and Truman was tied down by Roosevelt's commitments, so Stalin got his way again.   The casual reader should also receive the message that the """"Wild"""" expulsions by both Russian and Polish authorities were begun east of the Oder-Neisse Line and long before the end of July 1945 Potsdam Conference which ONLY authorized the ethnic cleansing of Germans from within the 1937 borders of Poland, and from Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

I seem to recall RJ saying it was his intention to release the last book as a single book even if needed a new form of book binding to be invented or sold on library carts. If I recall correct, then I can’t help but feel this is NOT at all what he intended to happen.

I can wait for it be bound into a single handcover book. In fact, if that simple intent can’t be honoured, I have to wonder about the story line itself. 

Maybe I can do without “book 12″ entirely.

Anyone who believes this staggered three volume release is being done for anything other than profit is kidding themselves. If it is not about profits release all three volumes at once, don’t wait for the money that will be generated from three separate hard cover and paperback releases for each volume. This is not about Jordan or his loyal fans. This is about TOR milking it for everything it is worth. This is a slap in the face to every Sci/FI and Fantasy reader that has supported TOR through the years.

Louis Says:

Releasing this in three volumes is a terrible and sad idea. Readers of the wheel of time series have been waiting 15 plus years to a conclusion to this extraordinary series. Now you are asking them to wait three more yea`rs. This is all being done in the name of profit. Jordan did not want it to go done this way. I am deeply saddened by TOR’S greedy decision.

BOYCOTT ALL TOR AND SANDERSON BOOKS UNTIL SERIES IS COMPLETE!! i’m sorry but if this was really for the fan we’d have heard from TOR books, Harriet and Sanderson on such an OBVIOUS negative response. Consider this Harriet has no control over this book other then an editorial opinion if TOR books decides to replace something they can and will. More then likely there was a large advance granted to mr jordan upon the start of the book and unless the book is finished Harriet more then likely would have had to return that money due tyo the book being unfinished. Sorry folks but medical bills aren’t cheap and when some Corporation has you under contract you have no choice but to at least pretend you have some sort of control. Face it this is a business and the world is in a recession what is the garunteed way to bring in SOME MONEY? Plump up a story and add meaningless splits and’ milk it for everything it is worth, Corporate GREED at its finest again. don’t punish Harriet and not buy the books but BOYCOTT ANY OTHER WORK BY TOR OR SANDERSON UNTIL THE LAST VOLUME IS COMPLETE. WHO KNOWS THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE IT FINISHED BY NEXT YEAR IF ALL THE FANS BOYCOTT BOOK PURCHASING FROM THEM. PLEASE CONTINUE TO EXPRESS YOUR ANGER UNTIL WE HEAR A TRUTHFUL ANSWER FROM ANYONE OF THESE KNUCKLE HEADS.

 Bot automation at Wikipedia:Today's articles for improvement 

Over the past two weeks, there has been extensive discussion on introducing bot automation to assist with maintenance of the Today's Articles for Improvement project. A  has now been approved for trial and will carry out the weekly duties. The bots first run will occur around ' (midnight on Sunday).If you have been assisting any of the weekly maintenance tasks, please refrain from doing so this week. The bot needs to be tested and proven it can do the job, and it only gets one chance per week. The tasks will include:
 Adding the new scheduled article to Wikipedia talk:Today's articles for improvement and removing the entry from Wikipedia:Articles for improvement
 Set up the schedule pages for the new TAFI, except the adding of an image and caption
 Adding  to the new article for improvement, remove  from last week's article and add  to the talk page
 Notify relevant WikiProjects that the new TAFI is within their scope
 Send a mass message to everyone on the notification list of the new TAFI selection

Updating the accomplishments and archiving selections is still done manually, along with daily' tasks such as adding approved entries to the articles for improvement page. These will become automated in the near future.

We hope the bot proves to serve well, and by carrying out the routine housekeeping tasks we can boost the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the project.  thanks you for your service in helping with the weekly tasks in the past, and for your cooperation during this trial period )

 """"light"""" cigarette 

According to a decision on a lawsuit brought by the USA against Philip Morris, and Philip Morris own documents, the only difference between regular cigarettes and a """"light"""" cigarette is tiny holes placed on the paper that increase the air flow. This increase in air flow increases the mutability of the smoke, i.e. making so-called """"light"""" cigarettes even more likely to cause cancer and tumors than regular cigarettes. Philip Morris has been banned from using the term """"light"""" in the USA.

This is not true. Most light cigarettes are now made by expanding the tobacco, thereby having the same amount of tobacco have more volume, therefore, each cigarette has less tobacco, making them lighter. Not necessarily healthier, but most certainly lighter. But the thing about the paper being the only difference is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard. The filter is more dense for starters.

 Hungary during the Holocaust -The Kastner train 

             The 1955 Kasztner libel case: the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi.
The state of Israel claimed that Malkiel Grünwald's allegations against Kasztner were a lie. When Grünwald published these accusations, the Israeli Government did rather more than demand that his views should not be broadcast. Because a prominent Zionist official (Dr. Kastner was a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade and Industry) was involved, the Attorney General of the State of Israel prosecuted Grünwald for criminal libel. Let the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi (who later became one of the panel of three judges that tried Eichmann) in Israel's District Court of Jerusalem speak for itself.
The Attorney General v. Malkiel Grünwald
This material should be studied carefully. The masses of Jews from Hungary's ghettos obediently boarded the deportation trains without knowing their fate. They were full of confidence in the false information that they were being transferred to Kenyermeze. The Nazis could not have misled the masses of Jews so conclusively had they not spread their false information through Jewish channels. 
The Jews of the ghettos would not have trusted the Nazi or Hungarian rulers. But they had trust in their Jewish leaders. Eichmann and others used this known fact as part of their calculated plan to mislead the Jews. They were able to deport the Jews to their extermination by the help of Jewish leaders. The false information was spread by the Jewish leaders. The local leaders of the Jews of Kluj and Nodvarod knew that other leaders were spreading such false information and did not protest. Those of the Jews who tried to warn their friends of the truth were persecuted by the Jewish leaders in charge of the local 'rescue work'. The trust of the Jews in the misleading information and their lack of knowledge that their wives, children and themselves were about to be deported to the gas chambers of Auschwitz led the victims to remain quiescent in their ghettos. It seduced them into not resisting or hampering the deportation orders. Dozens of thousands of Jews were guarded in their ghettos by a few dozen police. Yet even vigorous young Jews made no attempt to overpower these few guards and escape to nearby Rumania. No resistance activities to the deportations were organized in these ghettos. And the Jewish leaders did everything in their power to soothe the Jews in the ghettos and to prevent such resistance activities. The same Jews who spread in Kluj and Nodvarod the false rumor of Kenyermeze, or confirmed it, the same public leaders who did not warn their own people against the misleading statements, the same Jewish leaders who did not organize any resistance or any sabotage of deportations . . . these same leaders did not join the people of their community in their ride to Auschwitz, but were all included in the Rescue train. The Nazi organizers of extermination and the perpetrators of extermination permitted Rudolf Kastner and the members of the Jewish Council in Budapest to save themselves, their relatives, and friends. The Nazis did this as a means of making the local Jewish leaders, whom they favoured, dependent on the Nazi regime, dependent on its good will during the time of its fatal deportation schedule. In short, the Nazis succeeded in bringing the Jewish leaders into collaboration with the Nazis at the time of the catastrophe.

The Nazi chiefs knew that the Zionists were a most vital element in Jewry and the most trusted by the Jews. The Nazis drew a lesson from the Warsaw ghetto and other belligerent ghettos. They learned that Jews were able to sell their lives very expensively if honorably guided. Eichmann did not want a second Warsaw. For this reason, the Nazis exerted themselves to mislead and bribe the Jewish leaders. The personality of Rudolph Kastner made him a convenient catspaw for Eichmann and his clique, to draw into collaboration and make their task easier.

The question here is not, as stated by the Attorney General in his summation, whether members of the Jewish Rescue Committee were or were not capable of fulfilling their duty without the patronage of the S.S. chiefs. It is obvious that without such S.S. Nazi patronage the Jewish Rescue Committee could not have existed, and could have acted only as an underground. The question is, as put by the lawyer for the defense, why were the Nazis interested in the existence of the Rescue Committee? Why did the S.S. chiefs make every effort to encourage the existence of the Jewish Rescue Committee? Did the exterminators turn into rescuers?

The same question rises concerning the rescue of prominent Jews by these German killers of Jews. Was the rescue of such Jews a part of the extermination plan of the killers ? The support given by the extermination leaders to Kastner's Rescue Committee proves that indeed there"

Thanks for explaining. Just to make it easier for the editors, please find below the suggested changes or references. We will only focus on the following changes.

How long would it take for editors to change the details/ add references? At this stage and after making the disclosure, can we go ahead and made the edits on our side?

1. Remove several events no longer organized by the World Sports Group: While they are not available as articles or news, the list of events can be found on the WSG website at http://www.worldsportgroup.com/assets/events/football/ and http://www.worldsportgroup.com/assets/events/golf/

2. Add information about how the matches are televised and fans should check their local TV listings.

- The match schedules are available at the AFC website at http://www.the-afc.com/en/fifa2014-schedule-a-results?id=116&type;=Stage

- In the USA, One World Sports will air all the matches. The match schedule can be found here: http://www.oneworldsports.com/scheduleday.php

- In Korea, JBTC will broadcast the opening of two matches in the final round of qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup finals in Brazil: The announcement can be found here: http://www.worldsportgroup.com/news/jbtc-to-broadcast-opening-korea-republic-fifa-world-cup-qualifiers/

  Statement on my block 

On 27 June I was asked by Thatcher to help deal with pro-paedo bias historical articles.  

I read your post on WR. I have just dealt with a rampant sockpuppeteer User:Burrburr and friends, whose main activity is to remove such pro-pedo edits from dead historical figures. I suspect he was correct on substance but the abusive sockpuppetry (80+ accounts) was unacceptable. It would be a good thing for a knowledgeable, non-sockpuppet using editor to perform the same sort of review, as long as it is done civilly etc. The pro-pedos will find it much harder to revert someone of relatively higher status (most of Burrburr's accounts edited for only a day or two, so it was easy to label them as vandals or """"single purpose accounts"""" and deprecate their edits). This is, of course, harder to do with an established named editor. Thatcher 

For example, it was being claimed with very little properly sourced evidence that Jules Verne was a paedophile.  I did so with the help of an editor called Phdarts whose contributions I looked at and judged worthwhile.  I made a considerble number of edits to the 

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&offset;=20080629&limit;=200&target;=Hinnibilis

""""rm politics reference - wrong chapter and is misquoted anyway""""
""""rm absurdly general and unverifiable statement""""
""""rm original research""""

in which I was helped by PhD.  There was no opposition at all from the pro-paedo editors.  

Then I caught this edit to Haiduc's page

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Haiduc&diff;=222250643&oldid;=221444762

""""Like you, I am much pressed for time, though I think that matters have gone beyond personal intervention - however well-authenticated - and now demand third-party intervention (as before). """"

This 'third party intervention' was not long in coming.  Phdart's account has been blocked for sockpuppeteering.  He was, as I suspected, a reincarnation of the banned Headleydown, but I did not have a problem with that.  He was editing under my supervision, and had made many strong contributions to the encyclopedia under other accounts.  (FT2 has pointed to some abusive edits he has made, but haven't we all).

I complained bitterly on FT2's talk page and have also contributed to a thread on paedophilia subjects to the Wikipedia Review.  I did not accuse FT2 of being pro-paedophile, I said that he was 'in effect' enabling the pro-paedophile lobby on Wikipedia.  I do not see how editors with expert knowledge of this subject area can possibly continue to work under these conditions."""

Sadly, much of what passes for journalism today is just PR stuff, which begs the question of how seriously we should take a lot of references!   

Well I might dabble in such edits, if I had more time. To be honest, I don't give tuppence whether my books are mentioned or not. It is of no advantage whatsoever to me, commercial or egotistical.

They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: the venom of saps is under their lips. Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the wicked: and from unjust men deliver me. Who have proposed to supplant my steps. 

The proud have hidden a net for me. And they have stretched out cords for a snare: they have laid for me a stumblingblock by the wayside. I said to the Lord: Thou art my God: hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication. O Lord, Lord, the strength of my salvation: thou hast overshadowed my head in the day of battle. Give me not up, O Lord, from my desire to the wicked: they have plotted against me; do not thou forsake me, lest they should triumph. The head of them compassing me about: the labour of their lips shall overwhelm them. 

Burning coals shall fall upon them; thou wilt cast them down into the fire: in miseries they shall not be able to stand. A man full of tongue shall not be established in the earth: evil shall catch the unjust man unto destruction. I know that the Lord will do justice to the needy, and will revenge the poor. But as for the just, they shall give glory to thy name: and the upright shall dwell with thy countenance. 

I have cried to the, O Lord, hear me: hearken to my voice, when I cry to thee. Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight; the lifting up of my hands, as evening sacrifice. Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and a door round about my lips. Incline not my heart to evil words; to make excuses in sins. With men that work iniquity: and I will not communicate with the choicest of them. The just shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me: but let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head. For my prayer also shall still be against the things with which they are well pleased: Their judges falling upon the rock have been swallowed up. They shall hear my words, for they have prevailed: As when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground: Our bones are scattered by the side of hell. But o to thee, O Lord, Lord, are my eyes: in thee have I put my trust, take not away my soul. Keep me from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from the stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity. The wicked shall fall in his net: I am alone until I pass. 

Hear, O Lord, my prayer: give ear to my supplication in thy truth: hear me in thy justice. And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight no man living shall be justified. For the enemy hath persecuted my soul: he hath brought down my life to the earth. He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been dead of old: And my spirit is in anguish within me: my heart within me is troubled. I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all thy works: I meditated upon the works of thy hands. 

I stretched forth my hands to thee: my soul is as earth without water unto thee. Hear me speedily, O Lord: my spirit hath fainted away. Turn not away thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning; for in thee have I hoped. Make the way known to me, wherein I should walk: for I have lifted up my soul to thee. Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord, to thee have I fled: Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God. Thy good spirit shall lead me into the right land: 

For thy name's sake, O Lord, thou wilt quicken me in thy justice. Thou wilt bring my soul out of trouble: And in thy mercy thou wilt destroy my enemies. And thou wilt cut off all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant. 

Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to fight, and my fingers to war. My mercy, and my refuge: my support, and my deliverer: My protector, and I have hoped in him: who subdueth my people under me. Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him? Man is like to vanity: his days pass away like a shadow. Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend: touch the mountains and they shall smoke. 

Send forth lightning, and thou shalt scatter them: shoot out thy arrows, and thou shalt trouble them. Put forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliver me from many waters: from the hand of strange children: Whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity. To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle: on the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee. Who givest salvation to kings: who hast redeemed thy servant David from the malicious sword:

A reply to the argument that Benazir Bhutto mispoke

Benazir was a highly intelligent, highly educated and ex-prime minister.  She is not George Bush.  She does not mispeak.  This is the biggest thing since watergate.  The proof that this is a cover up is shown by the following facts:

i) the experienced reporter David Frost who was interviewing Benazir when she """"slipped out"""" the fact that Bin Laden was murdered did not follow up on it.  In fact he looked palpably irritated and wondering quite how to paper over the issue.  He is in on the game, clearly.  If he was not in on the game then he would have pinned her down on this sensational bit of news.  

ii) Benazir was murdered in a wet job (this is a technical term) about a month after she mentioned that Omar Sheikh (note the triangle of first letters in history) was involved in Bin Laden's assasination.

iii) Nobody in the world's media picked up on a story that Bin Laden was murdered.

88683,"Anarchism versus Religion 

Anarchism what does it mean for this anarchist hobbyist?

Anarchism started the First World War over the anarchist assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.  A anarchist decided to interrupt a world power practicing imperialism and assassinated the Archduke as he drove by the anarchist in the tiny nation of Serbia.  What the anarchist did not know is that there were a multitude of secret treaties among no less that fourteen nations including attitude from the Ottoman Empire and within weeks the world was at war as Serbia was invaded.

The result of the war that started in the tiny nation of Serbia is millions of deaths, chemical warfare, proof of machine gun and artillery fire, introduction of aviation into warfare, the Russian communist revolution, and a new world order that led to World War Two, since the Germans believed it was their leaders who failed them causing them to lose the war.

World War Two led to millions of deaths and a larger battlefield across the world including China and the Pacific Ocean (Japan was part of World War One, but the results were insignificant compared to the bloody battlefields of Europe).  The results of World War Two led to nuclear weapons, a space race, spy satellites, nuclear ships, nuclear bombers, nuclear missiles, communism across the world from communist Russia, United States being called imperialist due to being a world wide undefeated military power who is unafraid to invade anyone except the nations with the largest and best militaries (Iraq had a lager but sad capability military).  World War Two also led to the Cold War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Desert Storm One that was the result of the former allies of World War Two dividing among themselves into two parties and fighting low intensity and hot wars across the world until the year 1991 including, for many families, three or more generations of military service from the United States.

Serbia as a result of the wars across the world of the 20th century has been subjected to the Muslims, Russians, United States, Germans, and civil war within itself and still has United States intervention this 21st century.  Under President Clinton Serbia was made smaller requiring a split of Kosovo and Serbia after a long bombing campaign that exhausted the stockpile of conventional United States missiles during the 1990s.

Serbia got its anarchy and is a backwards nation that has been under subjugation and gunfire since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Embrace anarchy and declare Heaven non-religion in a discussion section where Heaven is something of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faith where the other faiths are atheistic in nature and worship man by a code of conduct, then you should embrace anarchy and go live off the lands in a mountain.  You have little knowledge of mythology and I bet you have no idea what you are doing concerning religion other than your personal attitude."

 A tag has been placed on Basilecom requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  talk """

Robert Deegan 
General Liability Claims Section
Los Angeles Unified School District
333 S Beaudry Ave  28th Floor 
Los Angeles CA 90017  

Dear Mr. Deegan:

This letter shall constitute a claim pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act, Section 910 et seq of the California Government Code.

My address information in compliance with Section 910(a) and (b) is set forth above.

Per Section 910(c), (d) and (e), the date of occurrence was October 5, 2007.  I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.

LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.

David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.

LAUSD’s conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel’s office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.

Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Respectfully Submitted,

Migdia Chinea

This thread is a good reminder of why I don't edit Wikipedia any more.

 Dan56 POV bullying 

Hi Khanassassin-

I read your intelligent, and respectuful comments on Aaliyah's talk page.  Unfortunately, Dan56 seems to be trying to control every minute detail which I've edited.  He has reversed anything I do.  My main contention, like yours, is his subjective views on """"Critical Reception.""""  It's simply not true that Aaliyah received """"Highly Positive"""" reviews.  She received """"positive"""" reviews, as you stated, or """"Generally Favorable,"""" according to Metacritic.  If you don't mind, I'd also like to point you to a talk page from Nicki Minaj's album, """"Roman Reloaded.""""  Several editors there accused Dan56 of being """"biased"""" against Minaj, which I'd have to say does seem to be the case.  The Album received a score of 60 from Metacritic, which several editors wanted to show as """"generally positive,"""" because two highly influential reviewers, Rolling Stone and Spin, lauded the album.  Dan56 used Metacritic to """"verify"""" his POV that the album was """"mixed,"""" and then went on to revert any attempts by the editors to inject any positive reviews into the the first paragraph of the """"Critical Reception"""" section.  Here is Dan56's response to me, regarding my attempt to make the correction on Aaliyah:

This was reviewed in FAC (""""excellent"""" is cited in the source). Metacritic is not the be-all, end-all of review sources (they happen to omit several reviews from notable publications that are included in this article that they would now have included, such as Slant Magazine, The Guardian, Chicago Tribune and The Independent). Your other changes were reverted as well.

However, when trying to sway the editors on """"Roman Reloaded,"""" Dan56 says this:

We are being objective, which is why you're revision is not being accepted. You're trying to overemphasis two reviews to make them seem more flattering of the article's subject, and tactlessly rearranging positive criticism ahead of quotes from mixed reviews, which Metacritic clearly shows are the majority (yellow anyone?) 

I simply wanted to note what a score of 76 reflects on Metacritic, and Dan56 will not allow it.  What gives?
Thank you for your time.

To: Chzz
From: Howard Zimmerman

Chzz,

I had just figured out how to deal with References 4 and 5 and got them reasonably set up (at least to start).

But on looking at the article now, I see that the references are somehow in trouble and mixed up.

Another problem somehow developed. The drawing for Figure 1 is oddly placed.
I've attemted to give it more space, but the space is put partially before the caption
and the drawing doesn't move left but is oddly to the right.

Chzz, I appreciate your wanting to help. Especially in view of my uncertainty earlier about the referencing.

But is it possible to get the Article back to where it was this morning. I had just fixed up References 4 and 5.
I realize that I could improve them further but the basic job really was ok.

I think I can put the rest of the references in all right.

But I don't know if the article as it waa this morning is archived and can be retrieved.

If not, I can go through the article and see if I can get the right referencing. 

I haven't figured out exactly what went wrong. 

But Reference 3 should be to Krapcho and Bothner-By

Then Ref 4 should be to the 1961 Tetrahedron article

and Ref 5 to the Interscience 1973 article.

After that Ref 6 should be the Birch and Nasipuri 1959 article.

Chzz, if needed I can go through and experiment with fixing this up.

But I'm a bit uncertain about how to change the referencing although I can try.

AND, I don't know how to move the Drawing in Figure 1 to be to the left and centered.
while it was ok originally, my attempts to move it back haven't worked.

Thus if the article has been archived and can be gotten back, that would be simplest.

Chzz, it does appear that I've been the source of too much work for you. Neverheless
please do realize that I appreciate the help.

Best wishes,

Howard

Nothing is ever lost; the history shows all the previous versions, and all edits, back from when a page was made - see WP:HISTORY, and look at the page history.

I have tried to fix the refs from your description above - hopefully it is a bit better now; it's probably still not right, but considering most of it is correct, it might be easier to work from that. If you would rather just go back to the version before I edited it today though, that's easy enough, as explained above - or, let me know, and I'll put it back for you. Possibly it is easier to fix the existing, and refer back to this version.

Re. the figure, well, this is the problem I've been trying to describe. If you leave a number of blank lines to space the figures, then it might look OK to you, but it won't on another persons browser. You cannot rely on the text being the same size on their system, nor can you expect everyone to use a screen with the same resolution. This is a problem, with inserting images directly, rather than using the thumbnail system.  ►  

Two more things, to make our lives easier;

Please fix your signature, so it stops doing this 'unsigned comments' thing. To do that, click on 'my preferences', clear anything in the """"Signature:"""" box, and make sure that the checkbox """" Sign my name exactly as shown"""" is not checked.

When you make sections here (to leave messages), could you keep the title short? The long titles make it a bit unwieldy in the table of contents etc.

Neither are a huge problem; just trying to make things easier. Hope to hear more soon. [[User talk:Chzz|"

My overview

1. Intro: Euskadi ta Askatasuna is translated as Basque Homeland and Freedom, yet Euskadi (a neologism) is surely better translated as Basque Country, in the territorial and political sense of the term """"country"""". The term homeland is kind of totally out of place, as happens in some other article. There's no real equivalent for homeland in Basque or Spanish and sounds very strange. 

2. Aims: Mountolive seemed to insist in claiming (erroneously) that ETA's principal aim is to create a socialist state. This is not real, has been discussed before and can be documented. The current status is ok.

3. Secondary tactical targets: 
Drug traffickers (this has a """"citation needed"""" mark). I can't provide the citation but can say that in the early 80s it was the case. 
I would like a source for the Leitzaran highway, a more recent case, that I think is not so clear though. 
Possibly the complex struggle of Lemoiz nuclear plant needs its own article but well... there are no doubts that at some point ETA took it as their own circustantial fight and actually were decissive in stopping its construction. This may well justify a section of its own for this particular case but a separate article is maybe a better solution.

4. Context: the entry is ok as for now, unless someone has a better idea. There was a minor dispute about wether Askatasuna (former GG.AA./AAT) should be defined as """"anti-repressive"""" or just stated without any explanation. 

5. Social support is a little confuse and maybe POV. There's much emphasis on Francoism, what is surely justified, but the division Navarre+Araba vs. Guipuscoa+Biscay is interpreted from the Francoist POV more or less. After all, whatever the support that fascists had in Navarre and Araba, they fell in that side because of where the coup triumphed. There were only three cities in all Spain where the coup was aborted: Madrid, Barcelona and St. Sebastian (plus partially Toledo and Oviedo), the rest just fell where they got in luck. In this sense sentences like Since some Basque nationalists had sided with the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War, Franco restricted virtually any public expressions of Basque culture... are very tendentious. Francoism attempted and partly suceeded in emphasizing the divisions between the provinces with such tactics as declaring Biscay and Guipuscoa """"traitor provinces"""" but not Madrid, Barcelona, Santander or Murcia, that were also in the Republican side. 

The last paragraph of this section is also confuse. It's not clear what erosion may have suffered """"MLNV"""" (acronym is not clear for the English reader) in recent years. Sources are needed but HB-EH-Batasuna-EHAK support has oscilated between 18% and 12% (in all Southern Basque Country, Navarre included, where this sector is the largest nationalist one), with ups and downs, and is difficult to count in some elections because of the ban on Batasuna and anything of the like. 

The claims on Iparralde are rather false. More than 10% voted nationalist (mostly AB) in latest elections. But regionalism (claim for a separate Basque departement, greater presence of Basque language in administration, economic institutions, etc.) is widespread, being promised by politicians of all parties in each election and rejected by Paris right after them.

6. Tactics: I reviewed this part and mostly is ok. There's the problem of redundancy between tactics and victims and it seems Mountolive had a different approach, that has been partly discussed above.

7. Government response: the treatment of unionist paramilitary groups is too focused on the GAL ignoring once important GCE and BVE) and I'd like to see some material on the following:
Dispersion of ETA prisioners, history of it and its effects on militant prisioners and their relatives and friends (at least a mention to all those dead in car accidents while travelling to visit their imprisioned relatives). 
Recent legal and judicial steps on practical life terms
General replacement of Spanish police corps by Basque Ertzantza (in the BAC) and its influence.

The rest is ok, I think, though maybe the 18/98 procedure and the derivated ones need an article for themselves. I'd like also more info on the closed newspapers, radios and magazines, tortures to journalists of Egunkaria ([http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10179 reporters sans frontiers 2004 report). 

I think you can retire """"controversial"""" from Garzón - though I insist that he's actually quite controversial in fact, I admit it may break WP:NPOV.

8. Structure: it's difficult to expand due to the secretivity of the organization but some comments:
- talde means literally """"group"""" but it would be best translated as cell or commando. 
- I see no r"

Apology accepted, however even if the characterization is accurate for other editors, it serves no purpose in bringing it up.  Making disputes personal rarely enhances dialogue.  Anyway, I think you've concluded basically the same thing I have: such a broadening of definition would include many people who really should not be considered philosophers.  Consider, for instance, Ayn Rand.  She wrote on the topics of metaphysics, ethics, etc, but she did so rhetorically and without actually attempting to prove her points using syllogistic logic.  She contributed nothing to human knowledge, both because her reasoning was fallacious and because any of her actually valid conclusions had already been documented by previous philosophers (for instance, """"objectivist"""" metaphysics are simply a renamed naturalistic metaphysics).  I don't mean to group Dawkins with Rand of course as Dawkins is, in my opinion, a brilliant man who has contributed much to human knowledge.  But this is my point: using such a broadened definition puts Dawkins, Rand, Kant, Mill, and Russel in the same category, which I think is prima facie an incorrect grouping.  

Now, as to your point that philosophers will favor their own: well yes, but the same should be said for biologists and physicists.  When we write an article on evolution we value the discoveries of biology and not of religion.  Philosophy is and basically always has been an academic enterprise, starting with the post-religious works of the Sophists/Plato/Aristotle/etc as they founded the world's first philosophical academies.  Since then the practice of philosophy has undergone many manifestations but even among those differences it is generally somewhat easy to tell what is philosophy and what is simply on the subject of philosophy but not actually philosophy.  For instance, the analytical school of philosophy, I think, should not hesitate to consider continental philosophy something other than philosophy, it is just considered to be incorrect (being very general here).  From a Wikipedia standpoint, encyclopedias themselves are an academic enterprise and as such when we're considering how to assign WP:WEIGHT to a subject we do so by reference to experts in that subject.  Whether rightly or wrongly, the experts on philosophy have yet to recognize Dawkins as a philosopher, but as WP editors our job is not to determine whether or not Dawkins is really a philosopher, but rather to consider the expert opinion on the matter and give due weight to minority views when appropriate. talk """

You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are """"unencyclopedic"""", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than """"unencyclopedic"""", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.

 Hi Duxwing,
 Sorry for the very long response time.  The sentence """"a Y such that Z exists for X"""" is much harder to decipher than the other version and because of the nontraditional order of quantifiers; in some cases it may have different meaning as a mathematical statement.  (It is also not noticably more concise.)  For example, the sentence """"An element −v ∈ V for every v ∈ V exists"""" is impossible to parse because of the strange quantifier placement.  I suggest that if you are not familiar enough with higher mathematics to understand the importance of precision in quantifier choice and order then you should tread very carefully when editing technical phrases.  (Some of the other edits you made were unobjectionable or improvements, but they were all mixed in together and I didn't want to risk leaving an incorrect technical phrase.)

All I can state is that the novel has Elphinstone as the rank I stated, but quite possibly that was a literary tweak in order to make Christian the only Master's Mate. I'm certainly not going to claim the fictional variant is correct and all the non-fictional versions are wrong! Now that I look at Elphinstone's and Churchill's ages, Elphinstone (at 36) is 8 years older than Churchill (at 28) so it is unlikely, but by no means impossible, that Elphinstone was junior in rank to Churchill.  To be honest, I'm a bit confused why there would be 2 Master's Mates on the same ship with so small a crew - is that normal?  That would make it the only rank on the Bounty for which there was more than one instance other than quartermaster (and of course, able seaman!).

Well, thank you for your comprehensive answer. You certainly didn't need to provide an explanation and I'm sorry if I gave you that impression, but your comments explain a lot so there is some value there. Circumstances like yours can cause problems when we have guidelines like WP:QUACK; I'm sure you understand what I mean.

I'm not an admin and so can't (and wouldn't) really close the AFD, though as a non-admin I can re-list it to encourage more people to look at the article and did. My impression at this stage is that most editors seem to think Mr Roberts doesn't meet our general notability guideline because he hasn't received enough coverage in reliable sources. That he has won an award for his blog wouldn't normally make him notable unless it was a very significant award. Winning a notable award doesn't necessarily make someone notable either. But it's also possible that someone who isn't notable now, might very well be notable in the future. We call that WP:TOOSOON. In cases like that, the best bet would be to ask for the article to be userfied which means it is moved to your own user space until the subject is notable enough for the article to be published in the main article space. I have a couple of articles like that sitting in my own userspace. 

At the end of the day, it's not really about """"protecting"""" an article from deletion, it's about the Wikipedia community protecting the encyclopaedia from the inclusion of everyone and everything, ever. So we set and adhere to particular standards and things that don't meet those standards (even things that might one day meet them) are deleted. My best suggestion would be that you spend some time editing the articles of some very obviously notable people before trying to create articles for people who might not be. That way, if one of your articles is taken to AFD, at least you'll have a much broader understanding of policy and deletion procedures. At the moment you seem to be fighting a losing battle and that can be very upsetting, especially if people are throwing all sorts of linked acronyms at you that you've never seen. 111 """

The suggestion made above that this article could be deleted or merged as not notable represents a truly extraordinary """"reach"""". As was noted previously, the specific phrase that gives this article its title is used and discussed in literature from sources as diverse as the Air Force Research Institute and Israel's own Goldstone Mission report, which employes it extensively. Already mentioned in the article, is the (also extensive) discussion of the term in a report by the internationally recognized human rights organization, the Public Committee Against Torture in IsraelNo Second Thoughts: The Changes in the Israeli Defense Forces Combat Doctrine in Light of Operation Cast Lead, a report by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel; executive summary, with full report discussing Dahiya doctrine also downloadable at no cost.

Not yet mentioned are papers from the Brookings Institution, one of the most prominent thinktanks in the world, where a new-this-month analysis also discusses the doctrine in considerable depth.The Next War: How Another Conflict Between Hizballah and Israel Could Look and How Both Sides Are Preparing For It, an August 2011 analysis paper by the Brookings Institution; executive summary, with full report discussing Dahiya doctrine also downloadable at no cost.. Nor are any of the multiple scholarly articles that use and discuss the phrase and the policy it identifies mentioned in the article; see footnote.Search Google Scholar for """"Dahiya doctrine"""" (some sifting and use of spelling variants required); one example that discusses the concept under this name at some length is Legislative Attack, by Eyal Weizman, published in 2010 by the highly-ranked journal Theory, Culture & Society. A full-text copy can currently be downloaded from here, at a site that appears to correspond to a university course offering by its author.

Dershowitz even uses and discusses the phrase, as do Noam ChomskyNoam Chomsky interview in """"City"""" magazine, Tel Aviv edition, available on Chomsky's website or in its original context, here, at the magazine's site. and Norman Finkelstein, although Finkelstein calls it the """"Dahiya strategy"""" in his book, This Time We Went Too Far, not mentioned previously here.This Time We Went Too Far, a book by Norman Finkelstein..

Besides the JPost, Haaretz, and Y-net links already mentioned, Al Jazeerah uses the phrase.Al Jazeerah op-ed by Stephen Lendman, 31 May 2010. The New York Times also uses it, and discusses its implications.Tough Military Stance Stirs Little Debate in Israel, by Isabel Kershner, 24 December 2009, The New York Times.

Each in turn

Suggested: In physics, force is the perceptible cause of the acceleration of a mass (change in the rate or direction of its motion) and is experienced as a push or a pull. instead of In physics, force is what causes a mass to accelerate experienced as a push or a pull.
The addition of """"and"""" is good. However, a force need not be """"perceived"""" to exist. The definition of """"acceleration"""" is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it. We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead.
Provide definition: """"momentum (quantity of motion)""""
Hmm, this isn't exactly an accurate definition of momentum since momentum is, in fact, both mass and motion. Again, the wikilink I think should suffice, but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer. I want this to be intelligible, but I'm afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more.
Following the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a """"force"""" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the """"force"""" of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.
There is a slight issue here with the sentence: """"Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a """"force"""" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions."""" This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a """"force"""" associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.

 Neo-Nazis on Wikipedia  

With so much information online, there is a big need for encyclopedias. Wikipedia is not the answer.  Wikipedia has writers and administrators who squash the truth.   They are anti libertarian and they glorify totalitarianism with their Nazi-style behavior.  Wikipedia’s lies are so infamous that it has inspired a nationwide boycott, especially for the apparent Neo-Nazism of some of its more rabid writers.  

Wikipedia writers prevent any mention of the new historical discovery that the USA was the source of the Nazi salute. The USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the """"ancient Roman salute"""" is a myth. A image search on the web for the “original pledge of allegiance” provides additional information.

The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. Additional information is available in web searches for the text """"military salute became the Nazi salute.""""

Francis Bellamy (author of the """"Pledge of Allegiance"""") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel """"Looking Backward"""") and Charles Bellamy (author of """"A Moment of Madness"""") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement in the USA, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" and their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party"""" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. """"  Additional information is available in image or text searches for “swastika secrets.” 

Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas are based on the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not use the word """"swastika,"""" but called their symbol a """"Hakenkreuz.""""  

Recently, one Wikipedia writer became wiser and improved the """"Roman salute"""" article somewhat so that it recognizes and repeats some of Rex Curry's discoveries. Other pledge and salute articles on Wikipedia are as bad as ever.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America."""" Wikipedia liars also used the painting """"The Oath of the Horatii"""" as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates “1787?-1934?” with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.

Similar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.

Wikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer """"public schools"""" when they mean """"government schools"""" and they both cover-up the Bellamys' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called """"military socialism"""") within government schools. The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military. Those points also help explain why Francis Bellamy enjoyed starting the pledge with a military salute.

Some regular writers on Wikipedia knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of"

 Detailed chronology - 2 

Now that the legalities are covered...

This is massive material. It tends to overwhelm the article, which is now bloated to three times the recommended size of a Wikipedia article. I think we need to summarize here and factor out to separate articles, maybe one for each year.
While clearly well researched, the material is quite POV in the selection of what it covers. I'm firmly on the side of the Republic  one of the first things I ever learned to say in Spanish was """"Sueño y una ametralladero y Franco se va paseo,  but this Wikipedia articles are not the place for partisan polemic. A chronology this detailed should also include the anti-Catholic atrocities by anarchists and other supporters of the Republic. This doesn't.
The material is written in indifferent English. Right now, I'm engaged in a copy edit, which is being made difficult by the size of this article and the current miserable state of the servers.
I do not think it is appropriate in Wikipedia to repeatedly refer to the Nationalists as """"the Fascists"""".  Would I call them that in my own writing outside Wikipedia? Sure. And someone on the Right would probably use different words than """"Republicans"""", """"legitimate government"""", etc. in his/her own writing. Here, I'd favor """"Nationalists"""" or """"Insurgents"""" almost everywhere that the article currently says """"Fascists"""". Does anyone want to present an argument to the contrary?
Anyway, I'm trying to clean this all up. Suggestions are welcome. So is help. I'm not sure how much time I'll have for this  it's not my main focus within Wikipedia, and I suspect that (for entirely good reasons) I may soon have a lot less time for Wikipedia than I've lately had.   | Talk 23:25, Jan 19, 2005 (UTC)"""

    * 46 Block

Hello, sorry for the long message.

In March 2005, there was a WP:RM request and vote (which you took part in) to move Úbeda to Ubeda, with a 6-3 result, see  Talk:Ubeda#Requested_move:_.C3.9Abeda_.E2.86.92_Ubeda (or perhaps here if renamed).

However, beginning in April 2005 and lasting several months, there was a survey conducted at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (use English)#Proposal and straw poll regarding place names with diacritical marks, with dozens of participants voting and discussing over an extended period of time.  The purpose of the survey was to try to gather feedback for what the policy should be globally.  Proponents of diacritics were in the majority, and in general, use of diacritics is widespread in actual practice on Wikipedia today (particularly since the Mediawiki upgrade to Unicode).

However, for Úbeda/Ubeda, Philip Baird Shearer is stating that the WP:RM vote takes precedence over the survey results, and a new WP:RM vote would be required to move it to Úbeda.  My position is that there should be a global policy rather than case-by-case voting  that was the whole purpose of the survey.  In discussion with him, I wrote:
Just as we wouldn't have case-by-case voting on, say, capitalization issues for articles (eg, prepositions in movie and book titles should be lowercase, globally), we shouldn't have case-by-case voting on diacritic issues.
See the discussion at Talk:Ubeda#Talk_page_discussion_on_page_move (or perhaps here if renamed).

As a possible alternative to calling a new WP:RM vote which might set a precedent for case-by-case voting across thousands of articles, I am polling all the participants of the original WP:RM vote to ask:
 Regardless of how you voted in the WP:RM voting, which do you believe should take precedence: the earlier WP:RM vote on the specific article, or the subsequent survey?

Note, since Philip Baird Shearer was one of the participants in that vote, he will also be receiving this message and thus will have the opportunity to respond."

If you carefully look at what I deleted (and the reasons why I did it, see in the discussion page on the article), you will hopefuly understand my motives and remove once more what I considered a paragrap that goes against the neutral pov policy of wikipedia.

 This CWCC story should go in wikinews as far as I'm conserned, it's an on-going story.
 I'm living in Cambodia since 2 years and while I've heard more than once stories of perpetrators buying the families of the victims to drop the charges and make false testimonies, this on-going story does not represent the general picture in the case. Right now the paragraph offers only one very subjective point-of-view, is focussed only on one case rather than trying to be general (like the article 'Cambodia' should be), and relies on only 1 more or less reliable news source
 The 'Cambodia' entry should not be used to try to make a point and help a person getting out of jail in a corrupted country.

Please remove this badly written paragraph that goes against the ethic code of wikipedia. Thanks ( )"
143943,"Some unreferenced text
Would you please substantiate with a reference the following insert, which I oversaw before in Founder section:
As such, Ismā'il was the last in line of hereditary Grand Masters of the Safaviyeh Sufi order, prior to its ascent to a ruling dynasty, and believed himself to be of divine Islamic and royal Persian descent.
If you can't substantiate or provide reference to it, this seems as clear POV and needs to be removed. Thanks."

Cheesr, I will not rant here; but you have answered the question. Does the Deragotis blog cite any sources? Is the Deragotis article anything but a independant blog? Once again, it provides no sources... Answer the question. If no, then it should be removed, according the very rules provided by Wikipedia. Answer that for me.

The answer as to your statement that a source can speak about """"things"""" in history at any time, is certainly true; but, we are talking about things in our very lifetime; when newspapers, magazines have proliferated everywhere in America. For you to expand the scope to comparing D.C. EMO of the 80's to an an """"event"""" orwhatever tothe year of the Norman's invading The British Isles is a classic sophistry. FOr the reasons stated above, in this context. 

I am simply saying that, your relying strictly on a criterion set forth on Wikipedia, to hamper what others feel it EMO (Scene) really is, in fact undermintes the very article on Wikipedia on EMO as it is. 

Am I ranting, or am I recting facts? The Deragotis article is merely exhibit A. You have not refuted my contention at all."""

I'm not following Dennis' logic here. The reference entirely supports the information in the National alliance article (and by the way, that newspaper is at least a worthy enough source as the defunct obscure newspaper where Redwood's letter to the editor appeared that is quoted at length. This is what the Friedman article says:

He also suggested consulting with Political Research Associates (PRA), a left-liberal investigative outfit with deep roots in the counterintelligence movement. Among its top researchers is former Public Eye editor Chip Berlet. PRA has been funded, in large part, by Richard Denis-a multi-millionaire Chicago commodities trader who was also one of the largest individual contributors to the Democratic Party in 1993. Bragging that he and researchers had worked with PRA """"for many years,"""" King said: """"They have the best files in the country on political cults.""""
.........
Berlet, like King, has suspiciously changed his public views on NAP over the years. In 1984, when he first took over as editor of Public Eye, Berlet told Newman in a phone interview set up at Berlet's request to set the record straight regarding the Public Eye's 1977 accusation that Newman was a cultist and a LaRouchite, """"I'm the new kid on the block at Public Eye. I'm the new editor as opposed to the old editor, and if there was some way I could avoid having to write articles about this ongoing topic [NAP], I would. Our analysis of your group has changed over the past few years, drastically with my assumption to editor."""" The next issue of Public Eye contained the following editor's note: """"As you will learn from a forthcoming article on Fred Newman and the IWP [International Workers Party, a group that Newman had headed up in the mid seventies], the Public Eye no longer feels it is accurate to call Newman's political network a cult.""""
That """"forthcoming"""" article, however, never appeared. Instead, three years later, right after Democratic Party high roller Denis contributed $75,000 to PRA, Berlet's Clouds Blur the Rainbow did.
The article clearly cites this in a NPOV manner as a claim that was made in a Newman publication, not as  fact, just like the claims of Redwood and every other critic and self-styled """"expert"""" whose opinions permeate this article to a ridiculous extent already.  """

Request for Clarification

Hello, Arthur Rubin (congratulations on your recent promotion to admin here at Wikipedia!). Your friend the Hillman agent seems to be MIA, so I'll be waiting until he/she/it gets back to renew my discussions with him/her/it. But as it happens, I just noticed that you responded to me in the CTMU AfD as follows:
 
""""The only kind of theory capable of 'resolving an intractable paradox of physical science' is a theory formulated on a level above that of the paradox itself; thus, using the theory, one can define a function which resolves the paradox by mapping its (otherwise conflicting) elements consistently into observables. [That was me; now here's you:] WP:BOLLOCKS. Well, perhaps, not, but no such (intractable) paradox is discussed here. — Arthur Rubin | (talk) ."""" 

I'm very sorry that I wasn't able to respond to you when you made that comment - too much going on for me to notice it at the time, I'm afraid. But now that it has come to my attention, I'm struck by its ambiguity. Do you mean that science generates no intractable paradoxes in the conventional or computational sense? (If so, I'd like to know how you've managed to deduce this.) Do you mean that such paradoxes may in fact exist, but that the resolutions are necessarily scientific as opposed to interpretative? (If so, I'd again like to know your reasoning.) Or do you simply mean that the CTMU - an unquestionably notable theory which was covered by large-circulation elements of the popular media, but whose Wikipedia article you nevertheless helped to delete - doesn't have anything to do with such paradoxes? 

I ask, of course, because you are a """"relatively famous Wikipedian"""" who participated in getting that article deleted, and as an important mathematician, must understand quite a bit indeed! More importantly, because you have taken it upon yourself to help arbit the math-science-pseudomath/science-philosophy distinction here at Wikipedia, I think we all need to make sure that you thoroughly understand it, and are not letting misconceptions contribute to possible conflicts of interest on the parts of other Wikipedians.

 Taking this to your own talk page as you don't seem quite as keen on listening to what I've got to say over on my page as you are hellbent on defiling everyone's edits for your enjoyment 

Alright, I've just had it up to here with you and your blasphemous claims of everyone's edits being """"unreferenced crap"""" because you're the only one who can't remain content of having others contribute to the site. I can put up with your labels of every edit you find disastisfactory to your bigoted tastes as """"vandalism,"""" but going through everyone's freaking contributions list to make it some White Man's Burden to undo every small trimmings of blatantly incorrect or dingy information is just pushing the line, so I suggest you don't break the 3-edit rule yourself if you're so pompously insisting the rules and law enforcements here are on your side.

Let's see back where this started in the Freeza section, for example. Like I said on my edits page, I haven't familiarized myself with making those neat little references at the bottom to add to my edits, so in straight, bold text as clear as day, I posted the chapter number where the psychic ability itself was displayed, and could well post an image to back up my claims, while each and every one of the rest of the information I posted was seen throughout his extended fight sequences with Goku and co., you can bet your money on it; it's not Berserk or Blade of the Immortal we're talking about here, but plain-out, simple everyday Dragonball, which everyone (save you) would be fully capable of seeing. 

Then, the Vegeta article? Please, Vegeta himself professed about the 17 million zenos required to initiate his Ozaru transformation which can only be produced by a full moon or his power ball that mixes with the planet's oxygen to create a replacement, which both he and Gohan used to transform, and after his tail was sliced off by Yajirobe, he fled to the Freeza Planet and stated that his tail would grow back after he came out of the healing tank with the tail stump in plain view. None of this is uncited information by any means, and you're well striking a chord with everyone's anger by hellbenting on removing all that on the crappy pretense that because you can't deal with someone else making contributions, you're right in labeling them """"unreferenced crap"""" or """"vandal"""" and digging through everyone's records like a 40-year old wanker to annul every effort.

This is in reference to a relatively new umbrella article on en-wikipedia named Ceremonial pole. Ceremonial pole is a human tradition since ancient times; either existed in past at some point of time, or still exists in some cultures across global continents from north to south & from east to west. Ceremonial poles  are used to symbolize a variety of concepts in several different world cultures. 

Through article Ceremonial pole we intend to take encyclopedic note of cultural aspects and festive celebrations around Ceremonial pole as an umbrella article and want to have historical, mythological, anthropological aspects, reverence or worships wherever concerned as a small part.

While Ceremonial poles have a long past and strong presence but usually less discussed subject. Even before we seek translation of this article in global languages, we need to have more encyclopedic information/input  about Ceremonial poles from all global cultures and languages. And we seek your assistance in the same.

Since other contributors to the article are insisting for reliable sources and Standard native english; If your contributions  get deleted (for some reason like linguistics or may be your information is reliable but unfortunately dosent match expectations of other editors)  , please do list the same on Talk:Ceremonial pole page so that other wikipedians may help improve by interlanguage collaborations, and/or some other language wikipedias may be interested in giving more importance to reliablity of information over other factors on their respective wikipedia.

> The Oohashi et al. (2006) results reveal some interesting contradictions. While full bandwidth sound was preferred to CD limited bandwidth (over a speaker), the test for the ultrasonic music band was inaudible when reproduced alone. Additionally, the preference for HFC was not replicated when using headphones, only with speaker presentation, ruling out the ear as the means by which the effect was produced. 



These are not contradictions. They are an essential feature of the study, specified and discussed in the paper. There is no contradiction here. Out it goes.(  )

 Contrary evidence and ABX tests 

Oohashi et al. pictured human brains when the test persons were either exposed or not exposed to ultrasonic stimulus. ABX tests only tell, what differences test persons consciously perceive or not during the test. If same research methods had been used and results were drastically different, that should be called contradictory.   
I will state that even more generally than previous: There are certainly many signals and irritants that human beings can be unconsciously exposed to, but nevertheless they affect human's well-being and happiness. For example several chemicals or radioactivity would do that. We just don't know the whole truth about ultrasonic signals yet. Some signals could be processed half consciously in human's brains: One feels restless or nervous but still does not know why."

Hey folks, since there's two users in this talk I'll just thread this here.  I promoted it to ITN on the reasoning that the removal of a state executive is, IMO, notable whether the subject himself is or not (though I'd figure it is inherent).  Seemed obvious to me that this was more than Wikinews, which is why I skipped the discussion phase.

Perhaps you might like to comment on my stance over here?  

 re:Image:AnotherVersionofthePast.jpg 

I saw your post to ^demon regarding this image. I cannot undelete the image because of WP:FUC #3.b. The image has not been reduced in size. I also believe it fails #2 in that it directly competes with the commercial opportunities of the copyright holder. #8 is also jumping out at me, because the summarized text in the article serves the same purpose as the image. There is not critical commentary about the design of the sight or visual representation of the image in the article Chronology of the Year Zero alternate reality game. Therefore, the exact image you uploaded isn't appropriate for use on wikipedia, and a cropped or reduced size image may theoretically be appropriate, but in the proposed article would just be decorative (and against out non-free content policy). Sorry, but I hope this explanation helps.- [talk] 
Thanks very much for the reply.  I understand your Fair-Use concerns, and hopefully I can address all of them.
FUC 3.b - Agreed.  If the image is undeleted I'd be happy to reduce it's size and upload the smaller version, but I can't really do that (download the high resolution version) until it is undeleted.
FUC #2 - There are no commercial opportunities at stake here.  Because of the odd nature of the website, as part of an alternate reality game, the only logical copyright holder would be either Nine Inch Nails, 42 Entertainment, or Interscope records.  No one is making any money off of these websites: in fact, they officially have absolutely no connection to any company, not even to the album (Year Zero (album)) that it is parallel to.  Reznor himself has stated the ARG is NOT a promotional device.  (see Year Zero (alternate reality game) for more info on that)
FUC #8 - Although the dates themselves are similar, the text is not.  The whole point of the originating website, Another Version of the Past is that there are multiple perspectives of past events.  The text in the WP article is a dry, point-for-point account: """"neutral"""" if you will.  The two versions of the time line presented on the website represent both extremes of the fictional issues at hand: pro-American, pro-government, etc and on the other hand extremist, rebellious, reformatory, etc.  The image provides the user an opportunity to see the POV/agendas at work and compare it to what actually happened.  For example the New Orleans floods are described as a """"Faith-based disaster"""" on one hand, and """"Why Bother with New Orleans?"""" on the other.  
I still believe the image wouldn't be appropriate here. The site the image came from is copyrighted, and was used to promote the album (for the record company executives), regardless what Reznor said, so FUC#2 still concerns me, and I'm not convinced of FUC#8 either. We can simply quote snippets of text without showing it if we want to discuss how the timeline is presented. We'd need to discuss visual aspects of how things look in order to show an image, IMO. I have asked another admin who is more versed in image policy to comment here, so be patient for a 2nd opinion. Thanks for your reply.- [talk] 

Greetings. I was asked to comment here. This image is essentially text, with decorative flourishes. As such, I don't see how  it could pass WP:NFCC#8, which requires that a non-free image provide encyclopedic information beyond what text alone could convey. I don't believe that the text alone, quoted, would be less informative than the image. (And I think that much text, quoted verbatim, would be a copyright violation, which is another indicator that this image isn't allowed.) All the best, –  (talk) (random) 
Ok, fair enough.  I know better than to argue with two admins. =)  Thanks for taking the time to review the case.

(It may be informative to consult side-effects information of Viagra and its competitors, some of which are effective for 3 days and advise medical care for erections lasting over 4 hours.) (t) 21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)

Further, the term ejaculate, like the earlier """"release semen"""" (that a well-intentioned editor  used to replace simply """"release""""), misleadingly suggests that fluid pressure of seminal fluid is at issue; i think research will show that there is no significant seminal pressure except that imposed in pulses by the prostate during ejaculation.  The real issue is indeed plain """"release"""", or rather release of either sympathetic or parasympathetic (never could remember which is which) nervous-system excitation, which in turn entails destimulation of sphincter-like structures that sustain the engorgement (and that ED-medications work by affecting).

As you know, having replied there before, this matter is already being discussed here, two headings up.  Perhaps the two heading should be merged to prevent confusion.  I'd hate for someone to stumble on this """"Recent Karwynn deletions heading and, by no intention of your own, think that I deleted disputed material without discussing it on the talk page.  Either way, here's what I have to say about the matter.  I know it's long, but bear with me - you might find the rambling actually makes some sense.

Weasel Words
Your examples of improving weasel statements should be appreciated for what they are, but unfortunately, they don't really apply here.  The full process you linked to involved escalating from """"some say"""" to """"BUsh's critics"""" to """"Michael Moore"""" followed by accounts of a specific statement, namely, Moore's letter to Bush.  Here, that process has not been fully employed.  Unlike the specifically referenced Moore letter to Bush, which was direct and obvious in who it represented, these sources themselves still contain weasel words; take this sentence: A White House long accused of squelching internal dissent and ignoring outside viewpoints.  Accused by whom?  As I said before, just because weasel words are sourced, even directly quoted, doesn't make them ok.  n your example, the weasel words were eliminated by referencing the source of criticism directly.  """"Michael Moore said whatever"""".  In this case, we still haven't discovered who is doing all the accusing.  To say that the Washington Post is making the accusation is inaccurate.  To say that the Washington Post says that Bush has been """"long accused"""" is an accurate weasel statement, not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia.  It fails verifiability as well, come to think of it: the article certainly doesn't bother to support the sentence.  Read it for yourself.  They just throw it out there.  Verifiability doesn't mean """"you can find it somewhere else"""", it means """"It's been or can be verified to be true"""".  Perhaps it can be, but this article doesn't do it.  Do you see the difference between this case and the example provided in the WP:AWW guideline?  In the guideline's example, the weasel words were overcome by citing.  In this case, they still remain, because they are inherent in the source itself.

Citing the opinions of these articles
Well, this problem should speak for itself.  Opinions, including those of journalists, should not be cited as support for a claim.  It would be one thing if these criticisms were being mentioned to verify their existence (see Laura Ingraham, an article in which numerous criticisms are used to self-verify, but not used to support a claim within the article that Laura Ingraham is good or bad or this or that), as they are for many public figures, but they are being used as support for this """"particularly notable because"""" statement.  As I said before, which was ignored this... well, I'll just repost what I said before.
It's not a neutral article, nor is it a notably important surce. It's just another source. I could find an article that says something along the lines of """"Stephen Colbert proved that he is a manipulative, arrogant polemicist who cares nothing for social graces and only wishes to make a name for himself by being extreme and controversial"""", and if I stuck that sentence in the article's main body and referenced it, it would be (rightly) reverted before long. The same if I found an article saying that the accusations against Bush being intolerant of dissention were just a knee-jerk criticism and a political tool, lacking any merit. We shouldn't be able to throw political commentary into articles without restraint based on the premise that it's """"sourced"""". This entire statement contains non-neutral commentary about the performance; I don't care if it came from somewhere else, it's still not neutral to include it.
So here are my thoughts on this point, summed up.
Citing opinions is fine for verifying the existence of those opinions/criticisms, but not for supporting the Wikipedia article's opinionated claims (which, see above, shouldn't be in there in the first place).
This article is not notable to the subject matter.  It's very broad, compared to the narrowness of the article's subject (and, even narrower, it's notability and the cause of it).  The specific criticisms are not uncommon, and the article's themselves are not controversial.  They are not important enough to be set apart as evidence pertaining to the performance's notability and Bush's reputation.  Additionally, the source is more focuse"

 The lies in how he built the clock 

I was reading the following section and I see lots of issues of truth in it:

""""His father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, said that on Monday morning, September 14, 2015, he drove his son to school and encouraged him to display his technological ability.[4]

In an interview on Al Jazeera's Ali Velshi on Target, Mohamed said the clock was """"built from scrap around the house"""" and that """"some of the boards were already manufactured.""""[5] He told Larry Wilmore on The Nightly Show that it took him """"10 or 20 minutes"""" to put it together and that he has built more complicated items, but that the clock was simple, using some parts that were scrapped off so that it was easier.[6] According to the initial report in The Dallas Morning News, he had done this """"before bed on Sunday.

Nowhere is there a paragraph underneath that should write """"While Ahmed claims he built the clock from """"scrap"""", it is well known among tech enthusiasts that it is simply the components of a digital clock with no cover. So what I'm asking, is it alright to add sources that show he was lying?

60289,"This page is dedicated to the Gnome Owl.
MEASUREMENTS: The Northern Pygmy-Owl has a body length of 7 - 8 inches, a wingspan of 15 - 16 inches, and weighs about 2 - 2 1/2 ounces.  
HABITAT: This owl can be found at forest edges near meadows, lakes, coastline, and forest clearings in deciduous and coniferous forests of western North and Central America.  
DIET: The main diet of the Northern Pygmy-Owl is small birds and rodents, and large insects. Occasionally, they will eat reptiles and amphibians. Pygmy-owls are diurnal(active during the day) and crepuscular (active at dusk and dawn) hunters. This owl will search for prey from a perch, pouncing upon it from a close distance when prey is found. 
REPRODUCTION: The Northern Pygmy-Owl nests in tree cavities. The female usually lays 3 - 5 eggs. Unlike most owls, which start incubating the eggs soon after the first eggs are laid, the pygmy-owl does not start incubation until all the eggs have been laid. In about 29 days all the chicks hatch within a short time of each other. The young owlets fledge at 30 days and are independent of parental care 20 - 30 days later. The young owls become sexually mature in less than a year.  
NAME DERIVATION: The scientific name comes from the Greek words glaux, indicating a little owl; glaukidion, meaning to gleam or glare, and may refer to the eyes of the owl; and gnoma, referring to knowledge, reasoning, or an opinion. The common name indicates the size of the bird and its northern range. This owl has also been called a Gnome Owl. 
INTERESTING FACTS: 
Unlike hawks, falcons, and eagles, owls do not have an expandable part of the esophagus, called a crop, to store extra food. Therefore owls, like pygmy-owls, will cache the remainder of their food in a hiding place and eat it later. This is especially important for small, high-energy species that must eat frequently.

Since pygmy-owls are active during daylight, they rely on their sense of sight to hunt. Consequently, this owl did not develop a good sense of hearing, silent flight, nor exceptional night vision, like nocturnal owls."

11417,""":Moncrief, do you even know what a shepherd is? I used to work on a cattle ranch, so I know a bit about this stuff. To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, """"A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others."""" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.

I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a """"rodeo cowboy"""" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise. Chris

I bring to you a guy who needs to be immediately sent off...Well, maybe we'll show a yellow card to the user, but his creation needs to receive marching orders as soon as possible!

Take a look at this invented player, Cristiano Sonko, in FC Porto (it does not appear in the team's article, but it did display in the SQUAD TEMPLATE until a while ago; i was able to find the template and revert it, still don't know how to remove the article). If you look closely, the made-up player's fullname, CRISTIANO SONKO DOS SANTOS AVERIO is a (vandalic!!) pun on Manchester United's CRISTIANO RONALDO DOS SANTOS AVEIRO (replacing RONALDO with SONKO and misspelling AVEIRO). I checked several sites and there is no SONKO playing either for PORTO or PAÇOS DE FERREIRA (youth or senior) as the storyline and infobox state, it's just NOT TRUE.

A: Absolutely yes!  It's pretty easy....just pick a concise and appropriate name for a new article on the expedition and start to build new content there.  You get started by putting the new article title in the search box.  If it's available you'll get offered a link to start a new article with that name.

I suggest putting some comments on the discussion page of your new article describing what you are trying to accomplish (same thing goes for the Shackleton article).  That way, other editors won't misunderstand what's going on.   If the new article is going to be under construction for awhile, it's a good idea to put a """"stub"""" notice at the bottom of it so folks know that there is more to come.  You add a stub notice by putting this at the bottom of the page: {{stub}}

As the new article takes shape and adds breadth and depth that the parent article lacks, you may find you need to tinker with the parent article to ensure that there is the right amount of detail there...not too much and not too little.  

Lastly, you'll want to find out what other articles exist that should link to your new article and add links on them.  That requires a bit of searching and digging around but usually isn't a problem and helps integrate your article into the broader encyclopedia.

Hi Mdnavman.

However, the DYK selection criteria  require that the fact be followed immediately by an inline citation.

In the (English translation) of the novel, Solaris is described as covered completely by an """"ocean"""", but parts of the surface are constantly changing as the planet appears to experiment with creating objects from the memories of the humans on the space station, such as landforms, structures, and of course, the resurrected humans.  So it's not a water ocean, it's a sentient thing.  IMHO, the novel is better than either film, but thematically, Soderbergh is closer to the novel than Tarkovsky, who really had no interest or apparent understanding of what Lem's book was about.  That doesn't mean Tarkovsky's film isn't a great piece of cinema (I think it is); it just isn't really representative of the novel.  """

From Parasaraprasna, Kapur Singh, Guru Nanak Dev University Press, Amritsar

 Thus those who see in the origin and contents of the Sikh
movement anything of this VaiSlJavism or the historical Bhakti
movement of the Middle ages, which was based on this VaiSDavism
or cognate propositions, show a complete lack of understanding ofthe
real nature of Sikhism. Beyond the fact that Sikhism is of historical
proximity to this Bhakti movement of the Middle ages, and that it
somewhat partakes of the atmosphere and temper of VaiSDavist
climate, it has not much in common with the latter. Among the
principal features of this climate are its anti-Brahmanical attitude, its
preference for vernaculars26 over Sanskrit, its total surrender theory,
such as Lokacarya's marjara27 doctrine, its stress on devotion through
image-worship rather than through knowledge, and its own peculiar
forms of ritualism, such as caste-marks.

It is easy to demonstrate that similarities of Sikhism with some of
these features are not so intimate or fundamental as to suggest any
direct or indirect borrowing."

My neighbor, Alan Blanchard, had said goodbye to his wife, Sheila, and gone up to Telegraph Ave. to work at the Berkeley Reperatory Theater doing carpentry.  He heard some noise on the street, went up to the roof to see what was happening and was immediately hit by a volley of buckshot fired by an Alameda County Sheriff's deputy.  He never saw another thing, as he was permanently blinded.  James Rector, who was standing next to him, had seen the deputy point his shotgun at them; he turned and was running away when the blast hit him in the lower abdomen.  He died four days later.

I was in Sproul Plaza for Rector's memorial service just after he died.  The National Guard troops surrounded the plaza and pointed their bayonets inward, while helicoptors dropped CS gas directly on the thousands of people who had assembled.

Welcome to Wikipedia.

A lot of people on Wikipedia are against Irish Republicanism, which can be frustrating.  I am something of a partisan of the idea of having an Irish Republican wiki controlled by Irish Republicans, and then coming in to Wikipedia as well.  At least that way you spend time constructively instead of wasting all of it with Orangemen, Paisleyites and Fine Gaelers here.

Anyhow, good luck.  You may feel you're being ganged up on, and you'd be right.  But some people here are on your side, like me.  And this isn't the only web site in the world."

Obviously I disagree with the note about the photographs. The term """"graphic"""" tends to inappropriately stigmatize the nature of the photography. The photographas, are clinical and medical in nature. They are scientifically relevant and in no way should be associated with things like pornography or """"grpahic"""" sexuality that somme cultures consider inappropriate for some audience. Noting that they are Surgical photos makes their content emphatically clear for anyone who might not be emotionally or psychologically mature enough to view them. There are plenty of articles on wikipedia about medical issues, with photographs, that do not include any such warnings, e.g.:

 Breast_implant/Risks_and_debate

 Breast_implant

If you took the time to read the entirety of the information Anne Lawrence, MD provides on Dr. Metlzer's work and techniques, you will see that his origination of his techhniques and procedures are documented there. See also the referenced article by Takta, LL and Meltzer, TR, in pubmed. I believe this article is being held to a ridiculous and unfair standard, that is not representative of the wikipedia. I believe that the microscopic treatment this article has received is evidence of bias against its subject matter, while the simple fact is clear that this surgeon is referenced repeatedly in other wikipedia articles about related surgical topics. In  addition, the very nature of the subject matter should be protected a topic given the level of bigotry, discrimination, and violence including murder against people who receive these medical treatments. The very fact that a surgeon like Toby Meltzer, with such a prestigious medical background, chooses to concentrate on such service to other people, who have few if any equally qualified alternatives, is notable by itself, without need for any further citation. These surgeries are in and of themselves pioneering, and largely non-existent on any measurable scale before the 1960s. Even now, the number of frequent U.S. practitioners is few, including only Meltzer and Marci Bowers, MD (who was previously a patient of Meltzer!), on a truly regular basis.  19:29, 17 September 2006."""

Notice to vandalizing halfwits, linkspammers, and people who don't read WP:NOT

Before you sit down and construct a series of vandalizations to this page, or whine about the article I put a CSD tag on, or my AfD vote, you should be informed that your world orbits a ball of fire. This ball of deadly heat is paradoxically far enough away that it actually provides some level of benefit to those who spend a measured amount of time in front of it. While you should not in any way stare at it, a respectful glance in its direction will show you that it is warm and in some ways healthy. 

Accompanying the ball of fire is a collection of variant photosensitive lifeforms and constantly recycled breathing material, suitable for your use at any time you so please, and containing life-giving elements. As an added bonus, most of these materials are available to you entirely for free and 24 hours a day. 

We encourage you to cease vandalizing or whining on this page and get to know the magic ball of fire.

Disclaimer: The above is intended as a humorous way to emphasize a point. If you are not humorous, feel free to continue to be a halfwit or linkspammer, or both if you prefer. You may also ignore the fiery ball, if you so please, however I warn you that without it, you would never have been permitted to enjoy linkspamming or halfwittedness or ignorance of WP:NOT.

WP:SYNTH
An RfC was just closed at Talk:Climate change denial#RfC: Must the word 'denial; occur in every citation for climate change denial?, and it is interesting to read the closing statement there, in that it reflects community consensus about some aspects of when to use or not use sources about a topic without violating WP:SYNTH.   
The concluding statement says the term """"climate change denial"""" may be used if the source """"implicitly states they fall into the general group.""""  It has no relevance to anything discussed here.  It certainly is not a loophole for """"synthesis"""".    
I don't think anyone is looking for """"loopholes"""". I'm not arguing for any kind of slavish devotion to that discussion here, just for editors to take a look, and to think about it with an open mind. I think that the closing statement makes some good points about common sense.   
There is nothing """"slavish"""" about the devotion.  If most sources say the motivation of the terrorism is secular, then we cannot say it is religious and call it Christian terrorism.    
 I was saying that we don't have to follow that other page slavishly. And that other page isn't talking about situations where most sources say something is unrelated. If you are interested in what it does say, then you can read it. If you don't want to read it, then don't. Everything here does not have to be a WP:Battleground.   
As I have noted before, unless reliable sources attribute some religious motivation or aim,  I would not say Wikipedia should attribute such a motivation or aim.  If the sources ascribe motivation to irredentism, economic or other attribute and do not ascribe a religious aim, then it does not belong here.  Note the discussion just closed at Climate*.*  where the result was basically """"no consensus at all"""".  Cheers.   
Not sure what you mean, but I linked to a discussion where the closer said there was a consensus. I'm not going beyond what the closing statement said there.   
The issue has come up in articles about terrorism and about ideology.  Different writers may use different terms to mean the same thing or the same terms to mean different things.  Generally, in peer-reviewed literature, the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines """"Christian terrorism"""" as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term """"Christian religious terrorism"""" with the same definition are referring to the same thing.  However, another author who uses the expression """"Christian terrorism"""" and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about """"religious communal terrorism"""" carried out by Christians, or """"nationalist terrorism"""" between different religious groups.
Can you provide a single source that should be included based on the opinion expresses in the climate change denial RfC?
  
I'm so tempted to just reply """"yes"""". And I really would rather not get into a wall-of-text over things that we will soon be discussing at the mediation. But let me try to clarify why I linked to that discussion. This isn't about definitions of """"Christian terrorism"""" in my view. It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word """"genocide"""" instead of the word """"terrorism"""". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link.

Are you being facetious? if not, you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres. If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same """"tag team"""" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.

It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under """"UK mediation"""" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you.

 Re:CUplex 

Hello Tungilik!

Unfortunately, you cannot, even tough you work and have access information at the City of North Battleford because no original research says """"original research used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist"""" which means if an article has no sources it cannot be notable and hence counted as original research per General notability guideline.

Make sure that your sources must be reliable, if you want to know if a source is reliable. WP:SOURCE says """"a source material must have been published, the definition of which for our purposes is made available to the public in some form. Unpublished materials are not considered reliable"""" You can use university-level textbooks, books published by respected publishing houses, magazines, journals and mainstream newspapers as reliable sources. Never use blogs as sources as WP:NEWSBLOG says """"Never use blog posts that are left by readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources.""""

Wikipedia strongly prefer """"free"""" files, wherever possible. When no """"free"""" file exist, it sometimes to ask a permission to use a non-free (copyright-protected) file under the """"fair use"""" provision. Ideally, most free files should be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons instead of Wikipedia. 

In uploading images, only logged in users with autoconfirmed accounts are allowed to upload images. Now, you first find out whether the image is legal in the United States (where the Wikipedia servers are located) also, if the image has not been released (to your knowledge) under a license, and is still under copyright you must gain permission to use the image from the copyright holder. Next if you're finish, determine which image copyright tag is applicable for your file.

In the procedure of uploading it, You can upload an image by using the Upload file link on the left side of the main page under Toolbox. Use good filenames because some filenames (such as highly generic filenames produced automatically by digital cameras) are disallowed, and attempting to use them will generate an error message.

Example of good file names:
 """":Image:City of London skyline from London City Hall - Oct 2008.jpg""""
 """"Sir John Betjeman (1906-1984).jpg""""

Example of bad file names:
 """"Image01.png""""

Parts of my own Talk Page deleted by editors who think they know better

Dear impartial but not disinteresed reader, Coren and I have been having an entertaining and enjoyable """"discussion"""" on the finer points of """"soapboxing"""".  She is of the firm, resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to """"soapboxing"""" and has deleted it.  I recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the """"investment predictions for 2008"""" section at the bottom of the page, but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section.  She has declined the opportunity to amend, leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed ever-so-gently against my back, with Coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is, in her God-like view, """"soap-like"""".  Not the most pleasant position to be in, I can assure you.

To use another example, picked completely at random: Let's say there's been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over, say, fractional reserve banking, and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in.  Then let's say I post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in-my-humble-view slaughtered version.  Is that """"soapboxing""""??

To use another example, closer to home.  Let's say a guy like Zenwhat says to his co-conspirators, """"What can we do to have OUR version of debt-based monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail?"""", like he clearly said here under the (desperate?) heading """"Heeeeelp"""".  

And then he also (bizarrely?) asks Gregalton help him delete references to Mises.org like he did here, saying to Gregalton: """"Also, in case you're interested, one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to Mises.org""""

As if a reference to the great Ludwig von Mises amounted to VANDALISM? Can you BELIEVE IT?  I have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this.  The guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll.  

He also says to his co-conspirator the following, on the same page: 

""""I looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. It made me realize that we're going around in circles. We improve the articles to the point that they look great. Then they get screwed up again. So, I had an idea: Would you be interested in helping me write an essay on """"Monetary Crankery""""? It could help people who AREN'T educated...The idea is for it to be straightforward, with references, but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.""""

Clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or """"satirizing"""" any positions on monetary theory that don't agree with his.  (The guy is mad.  If the guy had napalm or nukes he'd use them without hesitation.)   

Then, for good measure, he goes back to debt-based monetary system to do more """"editing"""".  

Zenwhat is clearly a piece of work.  Check out the dude's talk page.  In addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with Mises.org, his main interests appear to be something called """"cannabis culture"""" and """"the Buddhist connection with marijuana"""".  So, I gather from this that his main """"interests"""" are monetary theory and dope smoking.  What a combo!

Seeing this, I ponder my options.  I decide to post a note here, ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, asking readers to compare older (better?) versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions.  For good measure I offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the (eight?) people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page.  

It immediately gets deleted by all-seeing, all-knowing Coren as """"soapboxing"""".  Is this strict compliance with WP guidelines or a WP-style Fascist Dictatorship where people like Coren delete at will, but don't bother to make CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions as to how what I have written CAN come within the guidelines?    

This is like watching evolution in reverse.  I carefully construct a page with the help of others.  It gets vandalized by those WITH A CLEAR AND OBVIOUS objective to delete or satirize all references to Ludwig von Mises or the Austrian School (who knows what motivates these sickos?).  Instead of engaging in pointless edit wars with idiots, I ask t"

And thank you for your kind response and questions!  I'm always happy to help, it's never a bother!  Yes it is possible to undo or revert specific edits, or a series of edits in an article.  The new 'undo' button next to each edit in the 'history' tab of an article, can be used to try and undo that specific edit, it's success is dependent on there not being any conflicting intermediate edits between that particular edit and the current version of the article.  One can also go back to a previous version, by going to the article's history, and editing an old revision of the page. If you do this, any changes made since that revision will be removed.

 About Hispanic (Updated) - yet again 

First off, I take offense to your, """"relax, take a deep breath,"""" condescent remark. Never did I convey a """"nervous"""" tone with you in my plea for your understanding. I'm a reasonable and civil professional. Address me in a civil tongue or don't address me at all. Second of all, I'm of English and Spaniard descent who is sensitive to the falsehoods thus far stated in wiki pages concerning the English and Spaniards. For example, one of these falsehoods covers the notion that the Welsh population is huge in Argentina when in reality it is not as significant at all in numbers as the author of the 'Argentina' piece makes it out to be. Another false notion within the same piece - both explicit and implied - is that Italians are the majority ethnic race in Argentina, when again, the numbers show this is not the case. These and other idiocies which aren't true exemplify the need to update the info therein. Third of all, I read your bio. With all due respect, according to your ethnic background, you're not qualified to dictate the origins of other nation's histories, especially Euopean. I know my English and Spaniard history. You don't. I may sound like I'm talking out of line here, but seriously, I'm not. Don't take offense as I state the facts as I see them. This is why modification is necessary. There must be an appeals board within Wiki to whom I can supplicate my case. I hope that you understand my position. I look forward to making wiki a fair and informative base of knowledge. With your help, we can progress to this goal. Thank you."""

 Seth Material 

Oasis, thank you for the supportive comments that you made on the Seth Material talk page recently.

If you are truly a new editor, there are some things you need to know.  Wikipedia's rules governing editing and the behavior of editors are very poorly written.  They encourage people who have nothing else to do to spend hours and hours on the site each day.  However, once an editor has exhausted his knowledge, any contributions he makes after that are of dubious value.  The result is that there are contingents of what I call """"Wiki-addicts"""" who make little positive contribution to the encyclopedia, but who make a lot of trouble for other editors.  They generally call themselves """"skeptics"""", and they spend hours each day attacking articles they don't like.  They fancy themselves to be guardians of neutrality, but their edits are rarely neutral.  They also fancy themselves to be Wikipedia experts, and consequently they are rarely willing to collaborate.  Generally, they are atheists, right-wing Christians and political conservatives, and they attack articles on topics that are not in the mainstream, especially in the area of religion.  The Seth Material article has suffered from such attacks since it was created a couple years ago.  Recently, several """"skeptics"""" ganged up on me and got me kicked off the article.  The editors who are now in control of it have no knowledge of the Seth Material whatsoever, beyond the fact that they don't like it, so the article is now controlled by editors who would prefer to delete the article altogether.  They have already cut out portions of it.  If you want to see the most complete version of the article, look for the version edited by """"Itsmejudith"""".  You'll find text in there that has since been deleted.

Basically, my message to you is that Wikipedia is a hostile environment, especially if you are interested in topics of religion or spirituality.  If you have things to say in those areas, it is best to do it on your own web site.  With so many editors on Wikipedia intent on censoring information they don't like, it is very hard to make contributions in those areas without getting into non-stop edit-wars.  """

Regards reference 46, Framing abuse by Kitzinger, I got the book out of the library yesterday.  In the index, and on a brief flip through there is no mention of satan, satanic abuse, ritual abuse, the United States, religion, religious leaders, the satanic panic, courts, judicial systems, guilt, or anything else that really supports the sentence """"In America and Britain journalists framed the charges against the defendants as evidence of a moral panic and mass hysteria; child protection workers and social workers involved were bound by their professional codes of confidentiality and unable to comment on the specifics of the cases""""  There is focus on two cases - Cleveland and Orkney, both in the UK.  Based on my reading, the main focus of the book is on how the media's portrayal of the cases affected the public's perception of the event years later - not on guilt or innocence (though there is discussion on how the media left out and selectively reported details that were more convincing of the guilt of the parents.  If anyone on this talk page has read the book or is responsible for placing the text on the page, could you refer me to the page number (and chapter in case we have different versions) so I can verify?  Right now I'm tempted to excise the statement for having a) nothing to do with the U.S. b) nothing to do with the outcome of court cases and c) nothing to do with satanic ritual abuse.  If nothing else, it would allow the most nuanced, hopefully most neutral, portrayal of the book's contents.  Kitzinger appears to be very carefully saying nothing about the suspects' guilt or innocence, but I admit it is a cursory flip-through.  Got some other scholarly books from the same section in the library, some of which discuss SRA specifically, hopefully I'll find time to read them.    """

 Israeli-Palestinian conflict protect? 

Yesterday there were relevent and reliably-sourced casualty figures added to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict article, and some editors objected to this. It seems you were called in to quickly """"protect"""" the page from editing, effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. You cited """"edit warring,"""" the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. There are casualty figures in all the conflict, war, battle etc. Wiki articles I have referenced, why not this one? Thanks   
RomaC, the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only, which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. This article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. The fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. Here at Wikipedia, we value the ability to achieve consensus, and to be fair to many viewpoints. And believe it or not, we often do achieve that at the article Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were """"reliable,"""" without addressing any of the underlying issues, or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. 

To repeat: statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article's lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote, all in the name of objectivity, which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note, this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus, rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus.   

I strongly object to your calling me """"disinegnuous"""" [sic]. You wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with Hertz1888, who argued that the statistics might be biased. Do you not regard Haaretz as a reliable source? Please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably-sourced and up-to-date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war, battle or conflict is disingenuous. If you or any other editor want to add more statistics, covering a longer time period, then go ahead, but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. Yes, the edit """"sparked so much conflict and opposition"""" but note also also that here at Wikipedia we do not determine what is """"fair"""" through intimidation by numbers. There is a big difference between consensus and false compromise.   

I apologize if you felt I was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits, not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits, it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so, and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. I responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks.    

Apology accepted, and I will also make my further comments on the article talk page. I am not a single-issue editor I get around a bit on Wiki, saw the Haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. I can't say I know for certain why other editors deleted the material, I try to assume good faith, we'll see.

 Encore a mistake in interpretation  

Mr Shyamal, 

You made a serious mistake in interpretation, which seems normal for those who are not specialists in entomology and taxonomy in the dipterous ones.  But, please show me once again that I make an attack with the person of Rognes, because I must explain you where you did not understand.  

In your correct information for the articles of your Wikipedia, you must read and analyze all the bibliographical data and to understand well the problems of a taxon or a group of let us taxa.  Thus, you can note that Rognes is the only amateur faunist (and not a recognized specialist), who wishes to make """" revolutions """" in taxonomy, without knowing Bengaliidae, without knowing the morphology of dipterous (in general), without being able to make a correct identification according to the male genitalia even of usual Calliphoridae.  In more he wanted to introduce an aberrant and specific terminology for his pupils of the school of handicappers of Stavanger (Norway) where he works, and was unaware of always the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.  All its """" research """" is not recognized by the community of the specialists.  Only his friends of the same structure, namely:  Thomas Pape (the recognized intellectual robber and the most stupid taxonomist nowadays), C Thompson, N.L. Evenhuis, J.E. O' Hara and (unfortunately) A. C. Pont wrote a bibliographical work, nonscientific, in which they mentioned exactly what I have says to you before on Rognes.  He cannot identify any species of Bengaliidae and he does not have competence to establish that Bengalia testacea  is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  This false type was mentioned before by Sabrosky in a stupid work of bibliography (nonscientific), in collaboration with the same ignoramuses collaborators (1999:62).  You must know exactly that of Zumpt until Lehrer, the species-type of the Bengalia kind is Bengalia labiata R.D. - not B testacea sensu Duponchel 1842 & Rognes, which is a nomen nudum. 

Thus, for the exactitude of your encyclopaedic information you must change distort them given.  Moreover, I give you the council of reading certain articles documented by Lehrer in Fragmenta Dipterologica:  2010, 23: 1-`22 and 22-25;  24:16-20 and 20-23;  26:  21-30 [ [ http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Z._Lehrer ] ] and the work: LEHRER& WEI, 2010, Un nouveau genre oriental de la famille Bengaliidae (Diptera), Bull.

 Advice 

I apologize for your recent difficulties, your block was clearly undeserved. Our governance here at Wikipedia is imperfect and too often administrators abuse the power we grant them. While we can’t prevent it we can work around it - in this case by creating a new identity to bypass your block - what we call a """"sockpuppet"""" account. Officially it’s frowned upon but so long as it’s undetected a sockpuppet is just as functional as a regular account. In fact many current and former administrators are sockpuppet accounts. The instructions below provide an easy guide to creating your new account and avoiding detection.

Instructions
 Log out of your Wikipedia account, clear your cookies (google """"how to clear all cookies"""" for instructions) and close your browser
 Download a new browser: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer. This will be your dedicated Wikipedia browser
 Follow these instructions to permanently disable javascript in your new browser: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer
 And these to permanently disable java: All browsers
 Reset your IP address. With most  ISPs the procedure is as follows: unplug your modem, wait 10 minutes, plug it back in. Use this website (http://www.whatsmyip.org/) to check your IP address before and after to verify it's changed. If it has, great, if not you may have to wait a few hours or a few days before repeating this procedure successfully
 Now you're ready to register your new Wikipedia account

Tips
 Never log into your old account from the same network or with the same browser as your new account
 Don't choose an account name similar to your old account name; administrators will use that as an excuse to sanction you
 Don't edit your user page or your talk page straight away; it's a dead giveaway you’re not a new user. Remember, this user is “new” to Wikipedia
 Mess up a little - forget to sign or sign incorrectly, split someone's comment “accidentally” - everything to give the impression this is your first experience editing Wikipedia
 Avoid noticeboards and contentious articles until you’ve made a reasonable number of edits; sockpuppet or not experienced Wikipedians don't appreciate being held to community standards by new users

All done. Happy editing and welcome back. I hope your new experience will be more pleasant.    — John Whales, Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web

Check it out. I was trying to find an image for Tropical Depression One in 1988, when I came across this, which looks like a well-organized unclassified storm just off of North Carolina. On May 26 a cold front extended across the western Atlantic Ocean. The next day, a circulation developed to the southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, with much of its convection sheared to the northeast; at the time, it might have still been frontal. Tracking to the northeast, by early the next day the center became more involved with the convection, though only based on interpolation from IR. By the time of the first visible image, it was just off of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, possibly extratropical or subtropical, based on the (presumably) cold air being entrained. Convection deepened, and three hours later it looked tropical, which is where I found the image. Unfortunately, there's no more Atlantic visible images after that due to an error. Nilfanion found this visible satellite image, meaning it must not have been very deep. Here's another, and here's a small one. Verdict? Probably an extratropical cyclone and maybe a subtropical cyclone that had some aspirations to do something.  (talk)"

I invite you to read it if, for nothing else, the strange sense of deja vu it will likely inspire in you, as it does in me. Cheers."""" 

This it the type of patronizing rhetoric I've received from what I consider at this point, outwardly Anti-Catholic editors in this site.  I know there is a good faith policy, sure, but the repeated disrespect and blatantly forward condescending attitude is just too obvious to conclude anything less.  

I am aware you have supported the change of the article for the proper name """"Catholic Church"""" in the past.  I am determined to have our voice heard again and have this issue reviewed and hopefully repealed.  However, there is no way I can do this myself, I need you help and anyone else that may assist us.  (by the way where the due process ?)

My most significant points for change are found in the one of my latest post as follows:

 """"1)Using a geographic description in addition to the title of a Church has to be one of the poorest excuses. What is not understood is that regardless of additional descriptive properties """"Catholic"""" Church IS the common title of the Petrine Church in the equivalent manner as """"Anglican"""" Church is the common title of the Church of England...regardless of any descriptive meanings of the words """"Catholic or Anglican"""". If anything it proves how inappropriate it is to impose an extrinsic adjective upon an institution that is not titled in such a manner. If that is allowed then where does it end. Why not add to the Greek the Athenian Orthodox Church, or say London Anglican Church since the symbolic head of the Anglican communion resides there.

2)Since """"Catholic Church"""" is NOT a description, but the title of the lone Church titled as such, by far, historically, in the present and by the world at large it deserves to be title as such. It is not ambiguous, Anglicans do not say they are going to the Catholic Church, do they? Thus, no point in pulling out the ambiguity alibi Also, the article describes one Church, it is not a comparative study of several churches, no confusion to be entertained.

3)The personal ignorance of a Catholic which refers to himself as Roman Catholic is not an excuse to go by such a term. Many of these same Catholics are the same ignorant Catholics that think Catholics of other rites are not real Catholics. Thus, ignorance is no reason, if any a reason for proper education.

4)The listing of a Parish as Roman Catholic is reference to the Rite not the Church at large(albeit slang, where """"Roman"""" is interchanged for """"Latin"""") just as Byzantine Catholic churches are frequently listed as Greek Catholic Church. Since this article is discussing the Church at large and not the Rite, the usage within the church by the """"listing"""" excuse does not apply to this article.

5)The Church in the few instances where it does add the descriptive adjective """"Roman"""" it is used in reference to its Petrine primacy and only when describing or comparing the Church with other schimatic churches.  This fact, is perfectly exemplified in Pope Pius XII's encylical Humani Generis where he mearly mentions """"Roman Catholic Church"""" as he speaks of churches not in  full communion. Because, in that entire encyclical Puis referrs to the Church as simply """"The Church"""" vs RCC 46 times to 1.

6)Since, this article is NOT from within the Church there is no way to confirm that it is not mentioned pejoratively, thus the additional push to disregard this disrespectful term.  Face it, the only way to prove an article's description is not meant pejoratively is only if it comes from within the Church. (Wikipedia should not pretend that anti-Catholicism does not exist)

Lastly,Wikipedia is not a Protestant or Anglican outlet. I mean really how many Protestants, Anglicans, or Orthodox refer to themselves as """"Catholic"""", yet that article is presented from the non-Catholic POV(as well as Catholicism). Yet, the Catholic is supposed to shut up and take it - fine, I'll take that for the terms """"Catholic and Catholicism"""". However, we are not allowed the common title of our Church in the name of outlandish excuses, instead the Catholic is supposed to swallow a term imposed by others outside the church, Anti-Catholicism, as is the preferred connotation of those against the Petrine Church.[9] [10] Where are the concessions coming from the non-Catholics?

The injustice is truly preposterous! """"

Additionally, and possibly the strongest point is historical. (What do you thin"

Hi, Oda Mari. Long time no see. I hope all is well with you and that you're having fun editing. I've stopped editing here and moved over to a Japanese film-specific wiki.

Hi, I think that you are doing well with the GA review on the parathyroid gland. There are certain things about it that I would find difficult to describe quickly that makes me think that it is nudging GA status, but not quite there yet. Of course, the parathyroid glands and PTH are only part of a system that regulates Ca and PO4. Parathyroids have a thin capsule. According to my books, the sizes can be asymmetrical, so it would be better to say that a normal parathyroid gland is less than 60 g, than give the average weight. If you think that I could contribute something to the final phase of the GA over the next week or two, then I would appreciate it if you could check my grammar of anything that I added to the article.

This block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn't even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller's argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.

I went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi's edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a """"diatribe""""; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi's actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to """"justify"""" my position, unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday's edit was completely free from personal attacks; that's undisputable.

The very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday's tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as """"diatribe"""", an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that User:EncycloPetey broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.

If article talk pages aren't meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop's Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop's Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday's edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi's conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.(  )"""

Greetings,
I have seen your name everywhere already. Thanks for your recent attention to WP:PHILO and the aesthetics dept. I had recently been working on the logic project. I did quite a bit of work on it, and then ran up against some cultural issues.

I wanted to get User:SatyrBot (an apparently wonderful service!!) to automatically tag articles with the new logic banner for the purpose of assessment. I put together a category list, publicized the issue, and then moved forward with no objection. Well the complainers came out of the woodwork! The bot was stopped and at this point most have been untagged. I find all of this quite terrible.

Since then, I have been working on WP:PHILO with all of these task forces. I got the sense that people were a lot less uptight in general over there. I have changed direction a bit and now am advocating that the philosophy project tag incorporate these fields and be placed appropriately, etc. However, there is no real enthusiasm for the auomatic bot tagging proposal. Although there is far less hostility to it!  

I intend to ask the bot to tag just the Aesthetics project and see how things go. I haven't put this proposal out to WP:PHILO yet, I wanted to give you a chance to comment on it. Any advice or support in these goals would be appreciated."

They don't allow edits they don't like to stay up for more than 30 minutes, and their tactic is to bully and threaten people until they give up. Of course people do give up, because they become exhausted and worn down as nothing they try to correct will stay up. Interestingly enough, some of these people also police pages on subjects such as Aspartame and alternative medicine. It's frightening how the AIDS orthodoxy doesn't want the public to know the facts. Most horrifying is the effect on AIDS patients themselves, who have the right to know everything there is to know and to make their own choices. I'd be interested to know your uncle's history, whether he was taking AIDS medications, what AIDS-related disease he actually died from, etc. AIDS has turned into a fear campaign - they give you a death sentence, and tell patients that if they stop the drugs that they will die. I wonder if these mercenary editors here have any idea that their policing of these pages could be leading to actual deaths in the world, as thousands of people take poison in a desperate attempt to save their lives, when they are not even sick."

""""Aside from antimicrobial therapy, there is little in the way of placebocontrolled

and the mobilization of inspissated mucus, particularly with impaired
mucociliary transport from infection (viral or bacterial), is beneficial in patients
with all forms of rhinosinusitis, and ample oral fluid intake should be encouraged.
Saline nasal sprays are inexpensive and provide moisture to the nasal
cavity, reduce dryness, and help to clear secretions. Nasal irrigations, via a pump
(e.g., Water Pik, Teledyne, Fort Collins, CO) and an appropriate diffusion spray
tip, may be performed twice a day when the patient is symptomatic; many use
such a nasal and sinus cleansing regimen for months after sinus surgery until
the nasal lining reepithelializes. In those with bacterial carrier states difficult to
eradicate with oral or intravenous antibiotics alone, such as the Klebsiella of
ozena or the Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas of cystic fibrosis, antibiotics can be
delivered directly to the mucosa and infected secretions by adding bacitracin
(250,000 units/1000 mL) or gentamicin (160 mg/1000 mL; some use tobramycin)

Hi there,
I just noticed that the page for Bard Of Ely was removed from Wikipedia. [] I feel that there should have been some sort of tag attached to the page before removal. I also am mystified by the reference of the dismissal of the the page due to your comment,(promotion written by a friend). I have found that indeed Bard Of Ely is a noteable artist, and should have remained in the Wikipedia listings. For instance, did you know, Bard Of Ely has an EP out on a proper label(Crai Records), and he worked with musicians such as Crum(ex-Hawkwind[], Phil Moxham (Young Marble Giants), Robin Williamson(Incredible String Band) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals)and having compered and played at Glastonbury Festival [] and the Green Man Festival [] as well as having been rave reviewed in the NME []. I suppose it's up to the wandering editors to make these decisions. But, how do you determine a friend wrote the info on Bards page ??? For instance, I do not know Bard Of Ely personally, and could be considered a professional associate of Bard. Does this mean I can write a page about Bard Of Ely and it won't be removed ???? Please clarify the standards by which you elected to remove Bards page other than it may have been written by a friend. ie; For instance, the content was not verified and credible. Also, please indicate what makes an article not to the standard of Wikipedia, when in fact the references made in the article are internal links that have a direct relavence to the encyclopedia itself. I'm not trying to cause a stir here, but, I find it strange that Bards page was ripped down, when in fact I have found a few other artists pages that have been left up, and do not contain the same concrete documentation as Bard Of Ely's did. If you would like me to point those out to you, all you have to do is ask !!!! Take care, and please understand, that I am trying to understand some of the standards you work under for deciding to remove pages of Wikipedia noteable musical artists. Thank you, be well, and please accept my questions with all seriousness.

 User talk:Zoe molina 

Hi there.

It's great that you welcomed a user on User talk:Zoe molina, however, there were a couple of problems. I think that you probably used copy-and-paste, so, the links did not work, and the 'helpme' was actually on the page - the big 'I have a question' box was appearing.

Also, you added a non-free picture, and they cannot be used on user pages.

In future, the best thing to do is, use a 'welcome' template - you would put, for example. {{subst:welcome}} (and then sign with ~~~~. That will add a 'standard' welcome on their page, and all the links will work.

You could make a test page of your own - User:Percyfangirl44/test - and try it on there.

For more help, you can either;

Leave a message on my own talk page; OR
Use a {{helpme}} - please create a new section at the end of your own talk page, put {{helpme}}, and ask your question - remember to 'sign' your name by putting ~~~~ at the end; OR

It is also my belief that you rendered a decision that getting credit for getting one last article promoted was gaming the system. You noted that this type of credit was dangerous territory for the cup.  Clearly, just having articles added to a topic or repromoting a deleted topic could be gaming the system, but when a rule change requires taking a 17-article topic from 1/3rd  to 1/2 Featured content, it is not a matter of gaming the system.

The winner of this contest could come down to whether you grant me Featured Topic points for Wikipedia:Featured topics/Millennium Park. I earned FT points for this topic when it was first promoted.  At that time the topic was 15 articles and the requirement was that 1/3 of the articles be WP:FC and all be at least WP:GA.  Thus, I was acknowledged for bringing 5 of 15 topics to featured status.  However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 1/2 of the articles needing to be featured. Thus, I had to ensure that the two new articles be promoted to good article (which I did without a lapse in topic status) and that a total of 9 of the 17 articles reached featured.  Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 12), Millennium Park (August 31) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.

You're right that GCC doesn't like the denominational nametag,   but just like Vineyard many outsiders consider it to be and there is little actual semantic difference.  As far as what a movement is, a couple definitions I found were """"a diffusely organized or heterogeneous group of people or organizations tending toward or favoring a generalized common goal: the antislavery movement; the realistic movement in art."""" and """"An organized effort by supporters of a common goal: a leader of the labor movement.""""
 I say all that to say this.  Movement is a very ambiguous term, more appropriate to an idea.  You're right that GC does use the term frequently.  However, I think the best factual definition, and most suitable for our purposes and for accuracy within the title and intro, is """"GCAC is an association of churches"""".  That's what the AC in GCAC stands for.  Really, that's what we actually see in existence - churches.  Somehow we need to differentiate - I think we need to start with definiing the article as about an association of churches, because we have to pick a topic - that is one thing plaguing us at present as editors.  So let's start with something real, then trace the history of that association. and the present.
 I will re-edit the Today section.  It is not NPOV at present.  What I objected to was not the quote but rather your original sentence before it.  I was confused about the date, couldn't find it in your reference (I was in a hurry).  We need to focus on what we're doing here - we're putting facts up.  We don't need to interpret or extrapolate.  That quote from Bovenmeyer seems to be about  church leadership, with one sentence relating that to autonomy.  For that reason, while I think it should stay, it would be wrong to put that forth as the best description of the GC view of autonomy and congregational polity since neither of those is the topic.      Again, your statement isn't found in the quote.  The quote itself is fine, and appropriate - i don't see any reason that it needs a qualifier - as the quote i put above from the cong. polity article says, leadership/authority is a common integral part of cong. polity, and as we all have said there is no """"typical view"""" - if we're going to have cong. polity as a term in the GCA article, people need to go there and read it (also someone needs to put some serious work in on that article).  I don't have any problem with  deferring to leaders - i just want accuracy here.  Also note that there is a difference between an article in an official publication by one man and an official stance of the org (which is listed in several places), especially given the independence and autonomy of the churches within GCA.

But you're predicating the above on a false assumption, one I said was one of the things you're accusing me of: that fact is I have dealt with the issues Jdchamp raised, and done so in the proper forums, and intend to continue if I ever see a constructive argument come his way. The only extent to which I haven't has been me trying to do exactly the same """"Step back and take a deep breath"""" since Monday thing that you're now arguing I should do. I honestly started to wonder if this was my imagination, so I just checked, I've even had a healthy discussion on the """"poll"""" area with Strunke, one in which Jdchamp would have been welcome to join in had he had more to say than the """"I demand administrator intervention"""", """"You two are working together"""", type accusations he's been making.

If demand is high and supply is low, price is high... etc.  Petroleum can be stored in many places, such as in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (727 million barrels).  Global strategic petroleum reserves hold over 4 billion barrels.  Supply, which is the refined petroleum (and other liquids) available in the open market, is affected by releases of strategic reserves (note that production is not the same as supply).  Depending on the source you read demand and usage might not even be the same thing, as demand might include buyers for strategic reserves.  

Most of the big issues with Peak oil begin with the fact that until recently demand has grown very steadily for a long time, catching up with production.  When production can not go up anymore (and begins to decline), the strategic reserves will slowly be used up until supply also begins to decline.  Then usage will be forced to decline, but demand could theoretically keep going up (imagine a room with one cupcake, full of people yelling for more).  I hope this helps... let me know if part of this is confusing."

Put of the Frauen-Bundesliga instead, because they play matches for their teams outside the league too.

It is noteworthy that instead of watching his daughter and protecting her, Mark Lunsford was allegedly busy on the internet viewing child pornography. Ironically, many of the """"Jessica's laws"""" that Lunsford fought so hard to get on the books dealt heavy blows to viewers of child porn, like Mark Lunsford, yet, Lunsford was never prosecuted under the existing federal laws for viewing child porn which would have landed Lunsford in federal prison and required him to register as a sex offender. Contained in the documents released by the State Attorney's office were notes from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that mention child pornography on Mark Lundsford computer. The images & documents were found Feb. 24 — the day Jessica was reported missing from her South Sonata Avenue home — Assistant State Attorney Pete Magrino said the images were found on Lunsford's computer. However, he said his office is not pursuing charges. [3]

Plastic Surgery

Lunsford surprised many in July 2007 when he appeared in the media having undergone several cosmetic surgeries, including a face lift, dermabrasion, and eye surgery. 4

Father of Child Molester

In 2007, Joshua Lunsford, Mark Lunsford's son was arrested for having molested a 14 year old girl in Ohio. Despite Lunsford's public attack on all sex offenders, he seemed to be ready and willing to defend his own son's sex crimes and in fact may have played a vital role in the unequal treatment of Mark's sexual predator son. Joshua Lunsford was ordered to undergo sex offender evaluation but special treatment was administered and Joshua avoided felony charges and sex offender registration.[5]"""

It's better to go by the AEC than the ABC. Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Australian_politics/Archive_2#Election_campaign_articles where we established consensus that 0-5.99/6-10/>10 should be used for this page.    

Per the link above, the Australian Electoral Commission as well as SA's State Electoral Office use 0-5.99 marginal, 6-10 fairly safe, and >10 safe. On wiki we have also used >20 as v.safe. This is what has been agreed upon per the consensus in the link above and is used on all pages that relate to it such as the other link above. Thanks.

Well, per the link above, there is a ref which is http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/hass/staff/pendulum_new.pdf - a very good resource, post-redistribution, and then the standard 2004 results from the AEC which are in the division page refs, such as http://results.aec.gov.au/12246/results/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-12246-190.htm .     
    
No sorry.     
    
Nice work with all the infoboxes, but it was previously agreed here that infoboxes were superfluous to the article (you'll note that I preferred them to be included). In the interests of consensus, please raise this issue at the above link before adding any more, otherwise there may be a lot of removal, as I had to do earlier! Thanks.     
    
On another note, can I suggest that the infoboxes include the electorate's namesake?      
   
Additionally (I sound like I'm quibbling, I know - I do like the look of the new infoboxes) - are you able to make a template? This would make the inclusion and maintenance of the infoboxes much, much easier.      
    
The ones being used for the Sydney ones are out of date, representing the electorates as of 2004. I don't know if the others are uploaded yet.      
   
I've fixed the template up now, and changing them to templates. I hope you don't mind, but I removed some of the categories - I don't think anywhere provides information on population or density, and the """"last election"""" section is redundant as there's a table on that further down - and (I don't know if this was you) I'm making the allegiances according to the marginal-fairly safe-safe criteria used on the AEC, and I added the classification (inner metropolitan etc.) to the tables.

Mr. Swordfish, you wrote """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are making the bus speed up by pressing on the back of your seat.""""

Did you mean to say, """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are creating a force on your back by accelerating."""" ?

I think so.  You were making the (good) point that simply reversing F and a in the cause and effect statement seems intuitively absurd in this case.  But the F in statement 1 is the forward force exerted on the back, not the backward force by the back, and the a is the acceleration of the person, not of the bus.

If we make the reversal one of switching equal and opposite forces carefully, we come up with """"The backward force of the back on the bus causes the acceleration of the bus to be lower than it otherwise would be"""" which is different than the way you wrote it.  In this case there is no intuitive absurdity at all.  Both cause and effect statements are equally intuitive.

Crowsfoot is right that F=ma, or its fluid dynamics equivalent, doesn't by itself indicate an asymmetric cause and effect relationship.  If causes must precede effects, then we could even argue that F=ma forbids a either causal interpretation, since it refers to instantaneous values of both F and a (and m).  

But its helpful to the reader, I think, to go with the intuitively appealing bias that net forces (pressure differences) cause accelerations (of bodies or particles, or for us, of differential volumes of fluid).  The real difficulty comes when the reader wants to know if the pressure field is caused by the flow field, or vice versa.  We must get him/r to abandon this truly meaningless question, I believe, and understand that Newton's differential equation, and the continuity and mass conservation constraints all have to hold at the same time.  The infinite set of 3d velocity vectors and the infinite set of local pressures have to be consistent with each other, and there is no intuitively meaningful way to say that one causes the other.

I know Mahawiki has sometimes violated some rules, but remember that he was provoked to do so. You gave a warning on Mahawiki's page but you didn't warn any of the Kannada editors. If you don't know, all four(?) of them, Sarvagnya, KNM, Naveenbm and Gnanapiti had questioned the verifiability of the reference Mahawiki had provided. But had anyone else questioned it ? Still, Mahawiki e-mailed the file to everyone, then he uploaded it. Tell me wasn't all this done in good faith. Then these guys """"trashed"""" his citation. What were you doing then ? You should've warned them. Mahawiki had to provide an online link to the article, which he has now provided. I think these same rules should apply to them as well. I question the verifiablity of Suryanath Kamat. Even if Suryanath Kamat may be a good writer (which I know he is not), but is what Kannambadi filling pages with, the same thing from the book. Kannambadi may be filling something else. And references from a single book could be WP:NEO. What about that ? And another thing, the way you replied on Kannambadi's page reeked of bias and partisan attitude. Really, I was never so dissapointed on Wikipedia.

Hi Petr. Thanks for your help in looking at my article. I think you turned down my article. Was this for copyright reasons or for something else? As I put in my notes to Dori Smith, I am new to wikipedia and, though having done the tutorials, am still learning about it. However after the amendments I made, following Dori Smith not accepting my page for copyright reasons, I cant see that there are any copyright issues. The structure of the page matches all comparable organisations in the field. The content is laid out in a different manner to the organisation's website and with different wording. Some of it is the same, but this is as some of the wording in the sector is fixed (and used across all relevant wikipedia pages), such as private sector development in conflict affected environments or sustainable poverty reduction/economic development. Numerous references are made in the article. I would be very grateful for any help here. I feel a bit confused about where I have gone wrong. Thanks very much for your time."

Hello, Tgeorgescu... It was correct what you added, sourced, and valid what you put in, according to context, and according to WP due and undue and sources.  Your edit and addition were valid and correct, and arguably warranted, and I would never revert what you put it, because it happens to be referenced and sourced and what's stated by majority scholarship on this issue.   So it was a valid modification and elaboration etc.  To what I put in, that was also sourced.  As WP policy recommends, """"modify instead of wholesale deletion"""", to improve not remove.   And again, the point of Wilson and Cahill was in the context of the very section and paragraphs themselves, of rationalizing or explaining why Egypt herself never chronicalized things like the  10 plagues or the Hebrew exodus out of Egyptian slavery etc, or the destruction of Egyptian charioteers and soldiers or of that then reigning king of Egypt.   Of course majority historians discount it ever actually happening, but it's also known and admitted (as a general point) that ancient pagan nations or kingdoms in general would not always be so honest or straightforward or complete in their recording of everything.   Embellishing some facts and details, while minimizing or even totally hiding others.   And that was really the point.   Anyway, thanks for your work on it too.

 Are redlinks bad form? 
 regarding the Co-Freemasonry article: 

I was under the impression that redlinks in articles were quite acceptable, as long as they point to (nonexistent) articles on notable subjects that could or should be created. I could reinstate the links and create stubs for them all, but that would involve quite a bit of work; isn't the point that redlinks serve as useful signposts for others who might be able to contribute material? I'd like to put at least some of the redlinks back in...

In fact, I've just done a quick search and found Wikipedia:Red link, which agrees with what I thought. I'll add the redlinks back, checking as I go to make sure they're all notable and desirable articles. ☻ 

Check it, Fuzz: Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context. I agree, not all of them exactly need to be removed, but there's too many. Check policy, determine what should be linked, & relink it...:-)  

Righto, I have checked it, and I stick by my position. None of the redlinks should be removed. They are all relevant to the article. Please excuse me if I'm being dense, but which particular redlinks do you believe are irrelevant? Some of the blue-linked dates should be unlinked (those not containing both month and day, as per Wikipedia:Dates); apart from that, the links in the article are fine. ☻ 

Whatev's...;~) the idea of leaving many red links in is to give people an idea of articles which should probably be created, especially in a newly-created article. If they stay too long, &/or the article becomes long-of-tooth, then they should almost always be removed. Obviously, do as you feel best. I'm for sure not going to express too much care, not there...  

Thank-you for your comments. I'm not too worried now. I've run roughshod over people in the past, and I know how easy it is to do. At the moment I'm probably in danger of running roughshod over some of the people who claim to be Wiccan but have no initiatory lineage. Just as you don't consider Co-Freemasons to be Freemasons, I don't consider them to be Wiccan. The thing is, everyone editing here is doing so because there's a subject that's important to them, so there are bound to be disagreements. I feel like we're all on the same side, though, ultimately: our goal is to establish truth (or rather the wikipedia equivalent, verifiability), regardless of how many of our preconceived opinions are sacrificed in the process. ☻

 needs balanced perspective 

Climate change should be discussed with global warming entry – they are one and the same thing.

This has to be a balanced discussion also discussing the forecasts and uncertainties in forecasting temperature / CO2 increase which are proposed as the causes of the examples of climate change that are presented.

Discuss the politicization (sp?) of the entire issue, the role of IPCC, of Gore etc.  This is very much at the heart of the attention and emphasis being given.  

Discussion of post 1950s warming does not mention the pre 1950s temperature drop that is not explained by the forcings and “predictive” climate models. 

The forecasts / predictions are major part of the actual basis for the attention and emphasis in the carefully planned publicity campaign of the IPCC.  IPCC readily acknowledges that their role is to expand awareness to provide push for policy makers.  The 90 / 95 / etc. probabilities are without merit, are not based on independent scientific fact but Delphi polling of scientists who are doing the scientific modeling.  In fact, IPCC acknowledge that it is not possible to predict the future trajectory which is why they are developing scenarios not forecasts.  Scenarios assume a set of initial values or base starting points for the forcings and forecast how these forcings will play out over time.  This does not adequately take into account technological change that is and will continue to occur.  None of this is identified and discussed in this entry.

In this regard, some analogies with Thomas Malthus """"An Essay on the Principle of Population"""" (1798), [aka """"Malthusian catastrophe, Malthusian crisis, Malthusian dilemma, Malthusian disaster, Malthusian trap, or Malthusian limit (Wikipedia)], Paul Ehrlich """"The Population Bomb"""" (1968), Club of Rome """"Limits to Growth"""" (1972), as well as Orsen Well radio case of H.G. Wells """"War of the Worlds"""" (1936) as an example of how the media can be an  effective force in public opinion.

Both in the US and UK court rulings do not allow presenting / discussing the climate change issues without a balanced view of the issues such as mentioned here.  Wikipedia entries should also be required to be required to meet the same standards in presenting balanced views. 

The need for climate change policy is  based on economic evaluation of the future pattern of costs vs. benefit.  The Stern review – which is discussed – has been strongly criticized in peer reviewed journals because of its assumptions and approaches which very greatly favor support the recommendations, which is neither scientific or intellectually honest.  See e.g., the following references.

You seem to have missed the line at the very beginning: 'for current global climate change see global warming'. Merging them would be like merging the history of the United States with the 2008 presidential election...  

The global warming page in the terminology section states that global warming is an example of climate change, a subset as it were. The way these two articles are broken up is completely wrong. 122.104.2.224  

How so? Global climate change is purely the projected change of the climate. Global warming is an example of climate change - it is the heating of the climate. However, if temperatures drop, which many people believed before, that too would be global climate change.

Possibly both.

I see you want the teeth section better explained.

The idea is that tetrapods that grows slowly (i.e reptiles) continue to grow in maturity.

Mammalian teeth being complex, replacing teeth requires quite a bit of resources, and as anyone having children of pre-school age can attest to, it is also a lot of bother (try eating an apple without your front teeth!). Thus, for the fast-living, high energy demanding life of insectivorous mammals, tooth replacement is kept to an minimum (i.e two setts, a trait retained in their descendants).

RP, good point - it does say """"team that reached the final"""" (so, presumably, the team that won the semi-final?) but it goes on to discuss the team and players that played in Seville. In any case, if this article is to be about Celtic's UEFA Cup campaign in 2002-2003, if that is notable enough for its own article, then it should be titled something like """"Celtic FC UEFA Cup campaign, 2002-2003"""" (though that is a pretty ugly title). There is apparently no consensus on what 'the Bhoys from Seville' means, and no discussion of the term and its meaning in secondary sources.

I work with enterobacteria every day and phage therapy was discussed on an expert meeting I went to. Phage therapy was exhumed recently but most of us see the therapeutic potential overrated particular by the mass media. That is not to say that there is no potential but there is too much evidence against a widespread use. I think we all would like to have good handle in the light of multiresistant strains.

There is no real track record of tests that were carried out in the west but as far as we know some attempts were made in early years (failures are rarely published). There are newer test in the literature carried out in the food industry and in mice.
The idea that things were """"forgotten in the West"""" is often used to give weight to arguments but in modern research there is hardly anything left that is not written in English. There is a lot of information on the web that we should take into account, including positive arguments for phage therapy, for instance this review. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db;=pubmed&dopt;=Abstract&list;_uids=16258815
 
However, even in the postive light that the review draws, one should not forget about the severe problems that need to be tackled. Note that the problems of resistance also present phage therapy, the added amount of time to find the course of the infection and the massive allergic reactions you could provoke by phage particles.

 I think that """"a family of paradoxes"""" is more technically accurate, if you re-read the literature section you'll see why Hillman (the originator of this wording) described them this way.  Different authors have analyzed slightly different situations using different means.

 I also think accelerated rods are quite relevant and related (again, I borrowed this from Hillman, though I added the wiki-link to Born rigid motion).  Note that we are currently arguing accelerated motion with Rod Ball.  I would say that the topic is therfore closely related, though not identical.  That's just what the intro says.  Strings and spaceships share much of the same physics as rods and spaceships, in the final analysis.  It's fundamentally about distance.

 I think both versions contain equivalent information in explaining why the paradox, originated by Dewan and Beran, is named after Bell.   """

The interior of the fictional Masyaf citadel in Assassin's Creed contains an extensive library, and the rear is a lush garden above a sheer drop. These two properties happen to be known features of the real Alamut, which was also a Hashashin fortress at this time. Subsequently, it is likely that the fictional Masyaf is a combination of features of both fortresses.

It may also be the case that the in-game character Al-Mualim (""""teacher"""") is a portrayal of the real Rashid ad-Din Sinan, who was operating out of Masyaf at the time the game is set. Both characters are the leaders of the Masyaf citadel. In addition, both ad-Din Sinan and the fictional Al-Mualim die around the same point in time (e.g. 1192-4 compared to 1191).

 Hs Khalsa Recommendations 

I have several suggestions for how the Sikhism page can be improved.  I plan to list them below, one at a time, allowing time for comment on them before making the relevant changes.  After a suggestion has been considered and approved or rejected, I will move on to my next suggestion.

1)  """"The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the Ten Sikh Gurus and the select works of fifteen earlier bhagats as scripted in the Gurū Granth Sahib.""""

Problem: I feel this sentence is misleading.  As you know, the writings of only six Gurus are included in Guru Granth Sahib.  Perhaps this sentence is not meant to suggest that all ten Gurus are included.  However, a second issue arises because there are more authors than just fifteen bhagats included in Guru Granth Sahib as implied by the second part of the sentence.  

Solution:  """"The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten (lowercase 'T') Sikh Gurus, as well as (no 'the') Guru Granth Sahib which includes select works of numerous authors from diverse backgrounds.""""

If this is not detailed enough, perhaps all relevant authors could be listed.  In any case, just stating """"fifteen earlier bhagats"""" is factually incorrect.  Further, the emphasis of the Gurus was not on the background of the authors, but on what they had to say about God.

I also propose removing 'the' from in front of Guru Granth Sahib.  Guru Granth Sahib is not a thing.  It is not acceptable or appropriate to call Guru Nanak Dev - the Guru Nanak, or to call Guru Gobind Singh - the Guru Gobind.  Similarly, Guru Granth Sahib is a Guru of equal stature.  I know writing """"the Guru Granth Sahib"""" is extremely prevalent all over the Web, but we at Wikipedia should consider the merits of the case and hold ourselves to higher standards rather than just going with what is most popular.  Thanks for considering my post."""

So I hope you will oppose any version of FR that would not have prevented this case, as not being fit for purpose. In just the same way that a retraction will be due from Jimbo if he somehow comes up with a proposal that would not have """"100% prevented"""" the Ted Kennedy incident.

I hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is """"thankfully relatively rare"""", why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as Flagged Revisions is not very appropriate at all. I contrast it as the British Government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card, on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists, which happen to also be """"thankfully relatively rare"""". Why not for example in this specific case take a more intelligent approach, and implement sopmething that prevents or flags any edit that adds the word """"molesting"""", instead of forcing onto all BLP articles an incredibly blunt and incredibly bad faith assuming measure? (and any interested observers, please, stop before you say it, these valid concerns with what FR is/could be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant 'advantage' of FR of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles).

And to further address the specific example you give, maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim, when it was added to the article along with another 15 sentences, which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax, and at worst, screams delete me now for being total WP:BOLLOCKS. We can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal 'fixes the article for typos'  without noticing that it is 90% complete bollocks? Even when one of the typos is a few words away from the molesting red flag. A systemic failure perhaps?

And finally, as an admin, perhaps you can tell me why the IP user is not now blocked, irrespective of how long ago the edit occurred. Incidentally, the now famous bad account on Ted Kennedy was also not blocked immmediately after his first edit was a BLP violation on an unrelated article. Another systemic failure?

I'm all for criticla analysis of cases 'FR would have prevented', because they frequently pose more questions than they answer, about the whole model of Wikipedia, never mind how we efficiently and intelligently prevent BLP violations.   """

The main idea for chapter two, Nonverbal communication: its origins and development, is the awareness of events around the child such as gaze and gesture interaction, facial expressions, and modifying emotional expressiveness. """"With age, children's encoding (sending messages) and decoding (interpreting messages) skills increase. Yet children are better at decoding than at encoding, a fact suggesting that nonverbal comprehension precedes production"""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 35). This fact represents interpersonal communication and how it improves with age in children. 
The main point for chapter three, The development of language, is the social development based on the environment of the child. """"Children's nonverbal communication skills, especially those developed through interactional synchrony with adult caretakers, foreshadow the conversational exchanges that typify interpersonal communication."""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 57) Good interpersonal communication starts from the beginning with infant communication, mainly nonverbal, and so it translates to the developmental skills to attain high levels of communication. This chapter also touches on stages in language development which is a slight alternative idea to explain parts of interpersonal developmental process. The stages include prelinguistic development, speech perception/production, semantic development, private speech, and first words. 
Also, the main idea for chapter four, Developing verbal communication and how its relevant in children's acquisition of a variety of communicative strategies for attaining goals. A main focus is """"discussing the communicative intentionally substage of development"""" for infants """"emerging abilities to control their communicative skills"""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 105). All three chapters contribute to a more concise understanding of language how it contributes to the ideas of interpersonal communication development in young children.

Your accusations are false and malicious. You hurl accusations to justify your attempt to enhance POV editing in the article. There has indeed been bullying on the article but it has been directed AT me, not by me. You are obviously looking at this is a very biased manner. You punish Wikid for making a joke about a swine that offended The Magnificent Clean-Keeper. Yet, you punish me when I complain about horrible words being directed at me, including the repeated use of the """"F"""" word by The Magnificent Clean-Keeper towards me. There has been a great deal of harassment directed towards me, yet you totally ignore it or never looked into it. Then you make the totally false charge that I  misused mediation. That is outrageous. The mediator turned out to have a srong bias. He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator, in my opinion.

Research on Italian Somalians

I appreciate your improvements,Middayexpress. I have done some research on books about the Italian Somalians and I hope you can find what you need. 

About the catholicism in Somalia, here it is the exact words in the Tripodi book:""""Il vescovo di Mogadiscio, don Franco Filippini, dichiarava nel 1940 che vi erano circa 40.000 Somali cattolici, frutto del lavoro missionario specialmente nelle aree agricole del Giuba e dell'Uebi Scebeli"""" (my translation: the Bishop of Mogadischu, Franco Filippini, stated in 1940 that there were nearly 40,000 native Somalians of catholic faith, consequence of the missions mainly in the agricultural areas of the rivers Juba and Schebelle). If we add that there were 22,000 Italians in Somalia in that year and the aproximate population of Italian Somalia was calculated in 750,000 (there were no exact census), we have to agree to what writes Tripodi: 62,000 catholics in Italian Somalia (to whom we have to add the temporary Italian troops stationed in forts), or nearly 10% of the total population of 750,000. Of course there are other calculations of the 1940 population of Italian Somalia without the Ogaden, but most scholars agree in the 750,000 - 800,000 range.

I have written that 'The Italian Embassy calculated in 1993 that most Italian colonists used to have illegitimate children with Somali women and this fact has created a group of Italian Somalians with Italian roots, that now amount to nearly 50,000 descendants in all Somalia', because in page 38 Paolo Tripodi wrote the following:L'ambasciatore italiano considerava l'uso del concubinato un serio problema durante gli anni della colonia. Un problema che aveva generato -secondo lui- quasi 50.000 Somali con almeno un nonno o bisnonno italiano negli anni novanta. (my translation: the italian ambassador believed that the wide practice of concubinage during the colonial years had created the problem that nearly 50,000 Somalians had at least one grandfather or a greatgrandfather Italian during the nineties).

Speedy deletion of Mass (Masud)
 A tag has been placed on Mass (Masud), requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Forwarding is the process of actually sending data. It depends on routing, but routing can occur without forwarding.

Routing does not depend on having an aggregatable address.  For example, prefixes blocks on the Internet today are becoming less aggregatable.  This is a problem for BGP's scalability, but it doesn't make BGP less of a routing protocol.  In fact, there exist routing protocols which need no concept of an address at all, such as ROFL , distributed hash tables, many ad hoc routing protocols like DSDV, and various proposals in a research area known as """"compact routing"""" . In these protocols nodes have unique names but not addresses.

There may be more narrow senses of the word """"routing"""", but for the purposes of this encyclopedia article, I would say bridging is a type of routing.

To adopt your analogy, Ed Johnston is the systems manager guy in the wikioffice, with seniority, wide knowledge of the way it best functions, and a demonstrated capacity for making judgements all sides accept as neutral, and he's telling a less experienced wikipedian how this peculiar society works.  Most serious, professional writers, scholars and thinkers find this place exasperating and refuse to help out. Some just learn to bite the bullet, wear the bullshit, adapt to suppressing the 'Ah, you fucken dopey arsehole' sort of thought that passes one's article-parsing mind from hour to hour, and write instead, 'you're mistaken' or even 'you screwed up'. Of course there are lots of ignoramuses and liars here, like everywhere in the world and in every sphere of activity. Here, the rule is, if you want to lie or push a POV against the evidence, as long as you stick to the AGF rules, you can enjoy longevity while enjoying exhibitions of suicide by people who call you out. That looks outrageous, at first glance, but without it, tens of thousands of quite good quality articles on difficult and controversial topics would never have been written. Anthropologists, when studying a tribe in field research, understand that they must adapt, provisorily, to the rules of the tribe: back in their professorial armchair, a different discourse obtains which, were it thrown the tribe's way would (a) only be offensive (b) obstruct the acquisition of a tribe's ethnography and (c) ultimately, be detrimental to the tribe itself, which down the line may well need that expert's return to assist it in adapting in turn to a larger world outside of its own mental confines.

 Incorrect ambiguous name 

OK guys, the list is interesting and important, but it's name is ambiguous for following reasons:
encyclopedically, not all former Soviet republics joined CIS. Some of the CIS members are going to withdraw from the Commonwealth. But all of them certainly do use (or maybe modernize) military aircraft, mostly those Soviet-designed. Thus, the name is unadequately narrowing the subject
practically, CIS is not a purely military organization (or rather mostly non-military). Moreover, some of its members never joined th CIS military institutions and are seeking NATO membership. That's why CIS definition has little in common with military aviation equipment.

I can't answer questions without any information in them, sorry. You'll have to link me to some of the posts from these users that you're complaining about. I'd appreciate diff links, but I realize you're new and may have trouble making them. But at least tell me the page, the date, and the time.

 I find this statement fascinating in light of your assertions (below). 
 You have obviously looked around on some of the article edits in question. Why didn't you look at anything else? If you knew where to look at edits on the Dem Party article, I would assume you would know where to look for our dialogues.
 You keep making accusations at me and then state that you know nothing about the situation. This is hilarious.

 just some page dates and times:

 http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thewolfstar&redirect;=no 1.1 - 1.7

 concerning the Democratic Party (United States) article: Please be advised, though, that I can't undertake to comment in any depth at all on the content of the articles about American politics that I see you editing. I don't know much about the subject, and few of the names in the articles mean anything to me. That said, I expect I can recognize what you call """"how they treated you"""", """"ganging up"""", etc, if I see it. A sincere thank you for that (recognize ganging up).

 I wasn't asking for that exactly. But now that you mention it, if you don't know much about American politics I don't think you should be getting involved in my edits concerning American politics. The article reads, for the most part like a giant advertisement for the Democratic Party. It's improving now because I stood up to these...yes.. bullies.

 The editors have been making this article less biased due to my edits and my arguments
 See the differences in the article since I joined in this debate and edit war. Though, I guess you wouldn't understand any of the dsicussion.

Is there any excuse for their ganging up on, and even gathering people for the express purpose of ganging up on one person, particularly a newcomer to Wikipedia?Same''.

 these are only a few things that I remember or even was aware of:

AFC Creation
Please take a look at the articles created that were deleted.  Some of the sources I had previously used were not what they consider to be reliable sources.  After the non reliable sources were mentioned to me, I stopped using them.  I started to only use sources that appeared on google news or on google books.  I have even gone to the reliable sources noticeboard to see if sources were good to use.   The SPI wasn't frivolous as a number of editors were previously investigated as being members of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Papaursa/Archive     Other admins (. St★lwart111) have stated that there were problems in WP:TAGTEAM .   specifically    Most of my articles are about individuals who were are notable via wiki standards such as African Americans sports players during segregation James “Pappy” Ricks, Olympians such as Thomas Martin (judoka) or National Champions such as Howard Fish.   
With 140 articles about 9 have been deleted.  This isn't a horrible percentage. This is under 10%.  Considering that most of the individuals who were deleted were African American Judo fighters, I pointed out that statistic, to which they claimed I claimed I said they were racist or bigoted.  I never stated anyone was a racist or a bigot.  I pointed out a statistic.  After this issue was closed, one user tried to revive the issue, to which an admin stated """". Systemic bias is a recognized issue on Wikipedia""""    Some of the deleted articles, I am waiting for more sources to appear such as Al Gotay, which was speedily deleted even I replied to a prod, another user wrote another message stating it should be deleted (it never even made it to AFD).  
I have previously used Articles for Creation , but the backlog is so big that it is frustrating to use.   I did say, I create so others can work.  Meaning we all have skills that can be used on wikipedia.  To me an article is like building a car on a production line.  I put in the headlights, others put on the wheels, others put on the seats, etc.   I don't own any articles I create.  I rarely revert edits.  I find topics of individuals whom I believe are noteworthy and create them.  I look at some guidelines like [WP:WPBB/N]] and create articles from there (such as Negro League Baseball players or WP:NHOOPS such as players in the New York Rens    You did notice some of the bullying , and there is a lot the , such as I put in bogus claims , but I put in a simple explanation   and  
find additional sources .  I have improved in my article creation and firmly believe that if you put me on a creation ban, I will simply retire from wikipedia out of sheer frustration.  I am not disruputing wikipedia actively or passively, I am creating articles that for most people are notable and according to wiki standards are notable.    """

So at some point something about it has to go back in. The other is that most modern historians of science (Larson, Bowler, Gould) treat the foundation of population genetics as the start (Gould calls it the first phase) of the modern synthesis, not part of the run up to it. I realize this view differs somewhat from the view of Mayr who emphasizes more the later parts of the synthesis that involved the integration of other fields of biology with population genetics as the actual synthesis, but on this point I think, the article needs to follow the views of most current historians of science rather than those of Mayr or the other participants. There is a reason why historians do not rely exclusively on first person accounts of the participants in an event, and the biggest has to do with perspective.

As for the use of the term """"fled"""" - it's a good middlepoint between """"emmigrated"""" end """"expelled"""" that shows the element of fear was an important factor in the decision to leave, which is true and can't be ignored.

This is the first article I nominate to GA-review, please tell me if I miss anything. walk victor falk talk 

What about those taken prisoner by the British/Allies in the Middle East. Also those who refused to join the Free French in Britain and were repatriated back to France.?   
I respect this point, but we're talking about close on two million people in prisoner of war camps in Germany. That's what the scholarship covers and it's that which is covered by reliable sources establishing notability. Everything else, a tiny fraction by comparison, is generally only mentioned as a footnote to a general history of the campaign. Yes, French soldiers were probably taken prisoner from Indochina to Britain, North Africa to the Middle East. But they pale into insignificance when compared with the 2 million in Germany and this is why all the titles on the bibliography talk about French prisoners but only deal with the German-held ones. So I see your point, but I can't really do anything about it. It just isn't out there. '  
  Yesterday I was editing Free_France#Syria_and_East_Africa, and as it mentioned how only 5000 out of 40000 chose to join Free France while the rest wanted to be rapatriated, my immediate spontaneous/instinctive reaction was to wish for something like [[French WWII POWs#Vichy prisoners]] to target in this article. However, as  notes, some probably existed but their numbers are vanishlingly small and the result of special circumstances, such as beeing spies, obvious traitors & collaborators and suchlike that does not fall in what is considered a POW by international conventions; For the allies, rank and file Vichy troops were always offered a choice of repatriation, no questions asked, and their incarceration as POWs always a temporary affair.  I can think that more conventional perhaps such existed as Axis and especially Japanese ones after the coup in March 1945 eliminated any fiction of Vichy rule in Indochina, but sources about that might be very elusive to find; and anyway, probably more within the scope of the """"POWs held by the Japanese"""" wikipedia article. At the most, a short sentence summarising the above might be added somewhere, to dispell the same curiosity from readers that you've shown. walk victor falk talk

Edit 25 Nov 07
The anonymous editor immediately before me believed that they had """"deleted weasel words, tried to bring it back to a neutral perspective"""". The edit was a basic misunderstanding of the Secret History; I wouldn't be surprised if they hadn't read the work. The SH does indeed """"claim to"""" report, rather than """"report"""" scandals in Justinian's reign: the work remains completely uncorroborated by any other contemporary witness, and some of the purported scandals are so outrageous, the causes given by Procopius so bizarre and unknowable (viz., that Justinian was a devil and had the gift of invisibility), that much of it does not so much report anything as give vent to the bile of the author: that's why I let stand the deletion of """"apparently"""" (""""The Secret History apparently reveals an author who had become deeply disillusioned""""), since that particular word is a """"weasel word"""" on the part of some Wikipedia editor. But the so-called 'revelations' are indeed """"titillating (and doubtful)"""" rather than """"revealing"""" (and """"revealing revelations"""" is very bad copy editing, too). Similarly again, given that there is no doubt that the same author wrote both the SH and the Buildings, the panegyric of Justinian is undeniably insincere; since the Buildings bears the mark of official patronage in other respects, the panegyric can indeed be viewed as written at Justinian's behest, or something like it: stet.

The text above may or may not be truthful in its claims of the Persian poet's existence; in any case the poet and translator are both non-notable as far as I can tell; the poetry, furthermore, is quite bad (at least in English; I don't know about the putative Persian), and the explanatory sentences don't inspire confidence in the writer's clarity of thought. The use was commonly used? Sufis used this technique in Sufi poetry?

Why not delete it all? If we do include it, the passage we quote from the new Rubaiyat should not be three times longer than our quotation from Fitzgerald's/Omar's.

Whether a particular comparison to Hitler or Nazis is rhetorically persuasive or is excessive (and thus weakens the impact of appropriate comparisons) is not a matter of hard, objective fact (validity, or truthfulness) but, at least in instances where reasonable minds might differ, a matter of subjective appropriateness and degree.

Several years ago the New York Times published a letter of mine, but edited out my correct use of the subjunctive case. When I questioned the editor (very politely and deferentially), he explained the subjunctive is no longer used in modern English except for an assertion contrary to fact (e.g., """"If the Earth were flat, then ..."""")—which my subjunctive usage in the letter happened to be, although I continue to use the subjunctive wherever it is grammatically correct. Was I asleep when the subjunctive case was ripped from my language? Did the Anglos [sic] and Saxons posthumously defeat the Romans and seize linguistic dominance while I was away?

When I was in 4th grade, the teacher taught the class said that it was incorrect to begin a sentence with because. I asked why, and gave her a grammatically correct example of the usage. She acknowledged that my example was correct, but said one should not begin a sentence with because because that often leads to error (she was probably concerned about sentence fragments, e.g., """"Because it rained.""""). To this day, probably because of my resentment of the teacher dumbing down the language, I begin a disproportionate proportion of my sentences with because.

Peace.  (Talk) """

Hi Lulubyrd, would you be so kind as strike out or remove your post for the reasons I explained in the ANI thread? (Reader's digest version: because it's not true, I even gave you a diff, and because I'm bothered you'd say such things). If you would do, then perhaps I owe you an apology for not WP:AGFing and assuming you wouldn't. It's not like our paths will cross very often, if ever, but why not score another friend?

Like you said in the article talk, the sources I cited didn't support """"Sabbatic Witchcraft"""", and... hey now, believe it or not, I was aware of that. You are welcome. Polemics make it difficult to communicate effectively.. there was no dispute, and no good options... but if you had renamed the article Sabbatic Craft, no one would have undone it. Better still, if you had suggested deletion and mentioned there was already a writeup in Contemporary witchcraft, I would have been behind that 100%, (even just mentioning the latter, I'd have suggested the former), with redirect 'natch.

""""Sabbatic Current"""" works ok as a section header, but because it's so obscure, it couldn't be used for the article per the guidelines for WP:TITLE, and while """"Sabbatic Craft"""" would have been better in that regard, it's supposed to be proprietary—the kanundrum... In addition to struggling with the guideline, I was trying to find a way to go by what Chumbley said too... and that's consistent with what you thought WP should do, yes?

Do you have any concerns with the redirects for Sabbatic witchcraft and Sabbatic Craft?

It's a sure bet you know way more about Sabbatic Craft than I intend to learn. What did you think of the changes I made to Contemporary witchcraft#Sabbatic Current?

Can you please explain your edits to Biff Rose? They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. -Willmcw 06:55, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

For willmcw

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

[left unsigned by user:Steve espinola at ]

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. -Willmcw 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

I've copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. -Willmcw 23:29, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officia"

Hi Petebutt and thanks for all the hard work you're putting into expanding these lists. However, you're also causing quite a bit of chaos through, I think, unfamiliarity with how Wikilinks work.

To make a long story short, whatever goes inside the double-square brackets - [[ and ]] must be the name of the actual page that you're pointing to; if not, problems can occur. 

For example, in your recent edits to the Lockheed part of the list, you removed """"Lockheed"""" from some of the entries. This means that F-4 points to the Phantom II and U-2 points to a disambiguation page. If you want the link to appear different on the screen from the actual page name, we use what's called a """"pipe""""; for example - [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] will appear as """"U-2"""" on the page, but take you to the Lockheed U-2 article (try it! - U-2).

Hope this helps! You might also like to check out WP:AIR, the WikiProject that exists to co-ordinate Wikipedia's aircraft content. Cheers   

On that subject-  I've just rolled back your last text dump - it's full of broken links, bad formatting, and inconsistencies both within itself and with these lists in general. Please take some time to try and understand how wikilinks work and how these lists are structured. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a note on my talk page   

 Caudron C.230 

Hi again - apologies are unnecessary - we were all new here once! 

Thanks for the article on the Caudron C.230 - I've moved it across into the main part of the encyclopedia (you'd actually placed it on your """"userpage"""" - a page where contributors to Wikipedia may choose to introduce themselves, saying as much or as little about themselves as they want.) You can read more about userpages here, and if you want to create one, just click on your name (in red) that you see at the top centre of your screen. 

To create a new article in the main body of the encyclopedia, either click on a red link in an existing article or list, or put the name of the topic into the """"search"""" box at the left-hand side of the screen and click """"go"""". 

And again, if I can be of any help, please let me know on my talk page.   

 Various stuff 

Hi again - you're really getting the hang of things now. I'll continue to offer some unsolicited advice - if I'm bombarding you too much, please feel free to tell me to get lost! )

I took the liberty of moving your """"under construction"""" article from your userpage to User:Petebutt/Sandbox, which is the conventional spot to store such things.

A few notes from your recent contributions - these are all really formatting """"nits"""" (with perhaps the exception of the links) - please take them in a spirit of friendly encouragement and as a """"fast track"""" towards learning Wikipedia (and WikiProject Aircraft) style.

SectionsIn many articles, you'll see """"hidden"""" comments like . These have been left as reminders that if the article ever grows big enough to require splitting into sections, these are the conventional names for these sections (take a look at a major article like F-4 Phantom II as an example, and WikiProject Aircraft: Page content for the guide)
 the section will not become visible until the """""""" are removed
 in short articles, there's no advantage to using these; it's better to just leave them hidden - remember that we're trying to write encyclopedia articles in connected prose. One-sentence paragraphs (let alone sections) have little value here
 For experimental, one-off prototypes, the """"Operators"""" and """"operational history"""" sections are meaningless - just leave them out.

ContextYou removed context-giving introductions from a couple of articles. It's extremely important that articles establish context right at the beginning. There are a number of different ways that readers may come across an article; therefore the lead should establish straight away the what-where-when, and that for example, the """"Yakovlev Yak-25 was a prototype fighter aircraft built in the Soviet Union in 1947"""". Elaboration can (and should!) follow - but straight away, the reader knows what this article is about, and that this is not a car, washing machine, or something from Star Trek.

In response to Bduke's question 2 above, I think that it has become very difficult on wikipedia to say anything general about Guiding and Girl Scouting because someone will always point out that some Guides are boys. This is a fair point, but I think it has become overdone. If you take a look at the WAGGGS website, it's all about girls. Not girls and a few boys. They say of themselves """"The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts is a worldwide Movement providing non-formal education where girls and young women develop leadership and life skills through self-development, challenge and adventure."""" Their catchphrase starts """"Girls worldwide say..."""" WAGGGS has not felt it necessary to change its name.

I think that you might be a bit confused about what wikipedia user names are actually supposed to be for.  I'm not sure if you have another account, but user pages are supposed to be a little blurb about yourself to identify you with Wikipedia.  They're not supposed to be for holding articles about people.

Wikipedia has a couple policies that prohibit what you're doing:
Wikipedia is not a free host or webspace provider, and it should not store personal homepages.
Articles on people must be notable, or risk deletion

If you wish to store personal stuff, then you shouldn't use Wikipedia for it, since Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia.

 My concern about your username 
Hello, EELVIS AARON PPRESLY, and welcome to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?{{#if:The problem is that you're username is very similar to, and may therefore be confused with, the name of Elvis Presley.|The problem is that you're username is very similar to, and may therefore be confused with, the name of Elvis Presley.}}

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians.  Wikipedia administrators usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Usernames for administrator attention or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User names.

The case I know about is that autism used vcite instead of cite because of load time issues (Eubulides developed vcite for that purpose, but Eubulides is gone), and I remember at some point having a conversation with BogHog about the vcite vs vcite2 issues ... but the rest fades in memory.

Anyways, regarding about the 2000 New Flyer C40HF buses (5000-5222) they were at divisions 3, 5, 7 and 18. Although, a few of them were at SGV-3 division, when they were brand new and entering into service in the early 2000s, before being sent to divisions SB-5 and WSC-7. If you haven't noticed, a few of their cousins C40LF buses were at the same division they were, since one 5300 series bus was on line 180 in the early 2000s, when it was brand new. So, it wasn't the C40HFs that were at D3, their cousins were, too. 

Yeah, SB-5 division did have a few of the New Flyer D40LF buses (3000-3019) at one time, before they were sent to WSC-6 for almost their whole life, before 3 or 4 units were sent to Veolia Transportation (a bus contractor) in 2009 or 2010. I remembered riding one of those D40LF buses on line 115, when SB-5 used to operate that line, shared by SB-18,  which currently owns the line.

 Third opinion 

Hey. So I've looked over the conversation here, and to be honest, I don't have any problem with the URL category. It doesn't really strike as spam since they all seem to fit the inclusion criteria. The links might be more gracefully included than just the standard numbered link - maybe have it say clearwiki.com and have the link - but it seems okay. Similarly, WP:NOTLINK doesn't apply here since there is a lot more meaningful data attached to the entries in the list.

As a side note, I think it would be most helpful to this article to either create articles for each of the entries on here, or at least give some references as to why they're notable. I personally don't see the Alexa criterion as making it notable, and instead I'd just fall on WP:WEB as a way of determining notability. —  (say whaaat?!) """

 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Carlos Vives discography. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Carlos Vives. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Carlos Vives - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

If some admin is taking continuous interest in one particular area of articles, they must be having some kind of involvement/interest in the content in that area. That is not respectable adminning and will clearly lead to problems, as indeed it is here. It creates a situation where eds from only one particular orientation will have paramount power on article content and the eds on the other side will get butchered.

 Proposing renaming and new article draft 

Over the last couple of months I have produced a new draft of this article, working on behalf of New Leaders. The organization asked me to write an updated draft, better reflecting their new name and current programs and bringing the article into line with Wikipedia's guidelines. The most immediate issue with the current article is that the title is now incorrect. The organization has recently been renamed to """"New Leaders"""" and is now no longer """"New Leaders for New Schools"""". Due to this change, I believe that the article should be renamed.

I recognize that since I prepared my draft on behalf of New Leaders, I have a conflict of interest. So, before I make any changes, I'd like to ask that other editors read through my draft and my explanation here, and offer any feedback they might have. 

There are a number of problems with the current article, not least that it is rather promotional in tone. It seems that this has attracted the attention of editors in the past, as you can see from the warning tag. However, despite the warning tag, and the discussion that was opened by NDSteve10 on the Talk page (see above), there hasn't really been any improvement to the article in the last 12 months. No editors responded to the Talk page note, and only a few edits have been made. In fact, little has changed with the article since it was originally created in December 2009. 

The article currently has few citations, less than half of which are reliable secondary sources. The introduction doesn't adequately summarize the article, and certainly does not give a real sense of what New Leaders does. The most problematic sections are What it does and Educational impact, both of which are written in a promotional tone, especially the latter. In addition, the """"What it does"""" section is outdated, since the organization has since introduced new programs and initiatives. Meanwhile, the """"Educational impact"""" section provides a lot of detail, but would be better presented using Wikipedia's summary style. The information provided is cited to New Leaders' website, but makes no mention that the source of the claims is the organization itself.

I would like to propose a new draft of the article that addresses the issues with the current version, which you can view in my userspace:User:16912 Rhiannon/New Leaders

This is an entirely re-written article, using reliable secondary sources as much as possible, with new section headings to provide readers with a sense of the content at a glance, a new introduction which properly summarizes the article, and an infobox with all the key information about the organization fully up to date. The """"Creation and history"""" section now includes details of the organization's founding and expansion up to the present day. The descriptive information about New Leaders' has been removed, as this is more relevant in the new """"Function"""" section. The information from the current """"What it does"""" and """"Educational impact"""" sections has been rewritten under a new section heading of """"Function"""", which includes the organization's mission, its programs and its results. This section provides details of all the organization's current initiatives and an overview of the impact of these programs. I have retained the sections on """"Geographic reach"""" and """"Executive team"""", but updated the information in each and added citations. 

While I have put much effort into writing this from a neutral POV, I appreciate that due to my COI it may be that other editors have some changes to suggest. I welcome any productive feedback on the draft and my suggestion to rename the article to New Leaders. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or questions. Thanks,   """

VoluntarySlave, FrancisTyers, Aaron, I have already answered most of your questions above. I won't be caught in your mind games. I have answered your questions. Intangible has. TheIndivdualist has. Answering once is enough for any of us.

As far as the big section about Proudhon: Proudhon called himself an anarchist, agreed, but could not tell the difference between anarchy and government. So we may as well include a section on Daffy Duck and his influence on the movement.

This is an article about anarchism. Not Russian anarchism. Not European anarchism. Just anarchism. So it's not a big leap to assume that American anarchism (or the anarchism of other countries) should be included.

There is more on American anarchism that needs to be in the article. These edits are just a start.

I'll find references to show how Jesus was anti-authoritarian and revolutionary and he most certainly was. I can't account for why the revolutionary direction to his desciples was not included in the article  Jesus, I didn't write it. I can imagine why, though, LOL.

You do the same thing to, or worse, stuff that you accuse other editors of doing, and then harass them to no end. Like what you are doing to Intangible right now, which I just discovered today.

If it were censorship, all matter pretaining to the other languages usage in Malaysia would be removed. In fact, in the first paragragh, there are SEVEN ways how to call Malaysia in various languages and scripts.

 The official language box can only have Malay because Malay is the only official language. Unlike India, South Africa, or Canada or Singapore of which their constitutions say there are more than one official language, Malaysian constitution explicitly says only Malay is the official language. Thus - only Malay in the official language box. Wikipedia's job is to spread information, not make new information. See WP:NOR.

25305,""" issues, because these ones are unlikely to be resolved through discussion, and are usually very demanding on the MC members.

However, issues between users, such as Wik, Theresa, 172, VV etc... are typically issues that should go through mediation before going through arbitration.

It seems people are totally forgetting the procedure of dispute resolution as suggested some time ago. Arbitration is about punishment, mediation is a soft way to achieve dispute resolution between participants. It is a gentler way to resolve a conflict. And it is also meant to be more gentle on others participants as it is a private solution, which do not force users to see an ugly display of accusations, threats, insults and generally speaking attacks between users, as we can see these days here and on the mailing lists. 

I have a problem with this. The MC basically finds itself plagued by trolls, and good participants just plainly refuse mediation. So, how useful is the mediation committee ? 

I'd like to mention something. In real life, people are more willing to accept mediation because there is a cost to arbitration that does not exist with mediation. This cost is in particular that
 arbitration is a long process
 arbitration is costly
 arbitration is sometimes unfair

I wonder if any arbitration on Wikipedia should not have a *cost* to all those involved. Apart from very specific cases of troll handling, most conflicts between regular participants are *not* due to only one party. If arbitration was more costly, perhaps participants would be more willing to discuss first, before heading to punishement. Perhaps should they be a cost, whatever the outcome ? Perhaps should the decision taken by the AC more costly in case there was refusal to discuss ? 

I believe that the concept of formal mediation here at Wikipedia has been a failure thus far.  This isn't entirely the mediators' fault, but rather a process and structure problem.  Contributing factors include:
 Mediation is being considered too late in the conflict cycle.  Once positions have been staked out, publicly and in permanent media, mediation is much more difficult.
 To be effective, mediators must have unimpeachable respect.  Real-world mediators are retired judges, former statesmen, former heads of corporations.  They are effective in part because they are perceived to have discretion, and balance.  The parties they serve believe they will act predictably and fairly.  The committee at present includes some members not known for this.  Moreover, Wikipedians as a rule do not extend """"unimpeachable respect"""" to much of anyone (due to the nature of the culture here).
 Mediation requests are presently public.  They should not be (c.f. MeatBall:GetARoom), since it leads to playing to the court.
 Process is """"not yet fully decided"""" (Wikipedia:Mediation Committee), which discourages people who could, potentially, be helped; indeed, the mediation-releated pages have an unfinished, essay-like feel to them overall.
 Some private discussion amongst the mediators themselves might help in this regard (GetARoom again), since it is more difficult to reach consensus in a MeatBall:fishbowl.  The WP community should get over its """"all discussions public and archived forever"""" fetish, which is disfunctional.  Consider the success of the IRC channel (which is more private than the wiki or the ML).
 There are inappropriately informal expectations of the mediators themselves (""""Mediators are independant in their choice of whose case to mediate, and how to mediate.""""  Wikipedia:Mediation Committee) while there are rigid and overbroad rules for those who they serve (""""You will then have to agree both on a mediator,"""" """"The mediator will check your motivation as regards mediation,""""
 It may be necessary to send some people to mediation.  I can think of several cases where contributors could, appropriately, be asked by the community to discontinue their edits to an article or group of articles until mediation is complete.  Lots of real-world success with this.
 We have a problem with some articles where carefully-crafted compromises are undone by editors who weren't involved in the original compromise, which prevents healing.  I know of no good way around this, but obseve that it is a barrier to successful mediation.

Sorry, Dennis, but this doesn't convince me. You're saying that a Wikipedia visitor can """"check facts"""" for themselves by checking the sources, but this simply presupposes that the source is correct. It sounds like you're telling me that if I write an article referencing the Sump website, then that's just my opinion and it's unverifiable. But if someone else writes an article referencing the Sump website, then that IS verifiable, and that makes it okay. Well that sounds daft to me. It makes more sense to examine the preponderance of evidence and listen to counter arguments, albeit in the form of links). I simply don't accept the assertion that just because something is published, it's reliable, and if it's not reliable, it's a """"soft fact"""". It's just opinion. Yes, published articles are verifiable, but so what? An alternative system would be one where the Wikipedia author looks at other (offered) articles, examines them for credibility and rationality (even if the article contradicts the existing orthodoxy), and then decides whether to include a given link. But the boot-strapping system as employed by Wikipedia is illogical and is not likely to produce accurate or reliable articles. It's just as likely, if not more likely, to propogate misinformation. I won't be editing the Ariel page. Ultimately, faith underpins everything, not least the credibility of verifiable sources. If the Ariel page is wrong now, which it is, then it's will stay wrong for some time - and if that doesn't illustrate the fundamental weakness of the """"verifiability"""" dogma, then I don't know what does."""

 Notability Criteria - Clubs affiliated to Västerbottens Fotbollförbund 

Clubs playing in Division 4 and below may not meet Wikipedia's notability criteria.  If you wish to produce a Wikipedia page for your club I suggest that you ensure that you take appropriate measures to emphasise that your club is notable.  This may be achieved by including details of at least one of the following:

1. - club achievements in particular competing in the higher levels of the Swedish football league system (Division 3 and above 1987 onwards / Division 4 and above pre 1987); 
2. - a notable player(s) who has played for the club;
3. - widening the description of the club to include details of other sections of the club (some of whom may have made a notable contribution to their sport);
4. - significant club infrastructure that has been provided or is managed by the club such as an indoor sports hall and all weather pitches;
5. - special contribution to the local community such as clubs serving the needs of ethnic communities;
6. - unique features such as an island location or historic stadium.

Failure to meet notability criteria could result in your page being recommended for deletion.

4- To arrive at the total loss of 26.6 million the Russians assume only 450,000 persons emigrating after WW2. The actual emigration was about 1 million which means losses were overstated by about 600,000.
5-The Soviet population recorded in the 1939 census was 168.5 million not 170.5 million. Stalin ordered the number to be falsified.
6- Soviet civilian losses of  about 3 million persons due to famine in the territory not occupied by the Germans are included in the total losses of 26.6 million. .

At the help page you will read that if, as you have indicated, there has been no significant media or other independent coverage related to the cite then the cite is not """"notable"""" as defined by Wikipedia and cannot be the subject of a Wikipedia article.  

The guideline reads (in part): 

In the dictionary, notable means """"worthy of being noted"""" or """"attracting notice."""" Wikipedia bases its decision about whether web content is notable enough to justify a separate article on the verifiable evidence that the web content has attracted the notice of reliable sources unrelated to the web content, its authors, or its owners. Notability requires only that these necessary sources exist, not that the sources have already been named in the article.

""""Notable"""" is not synonymous with """"fame"""" or """"importance,"""" and even web content that editors personally believe are """"important"""" or """"famous"""" are only accepted as notable if they can be shown to have attracted notice. No web content is exempt from this requirement, no matter what kind of content it is. If the individual web content has received no or very little notice from independent sources, then it is not notable simply because other web content of its type are commonly notable or merely because it exists (see """"If it's not notable"""", below).

I hope, after reviewing this guide, you will understand why I was unable to accept your article. However, if you feel I was wrong and your article meets the criteria for notability of a website, you may wish to access the Dispute Resolution Notice Board to discuss the issue or seek a  Third Party Opinion from another experienced reviewer who may well take a different view.

Past Operational Deployments directed by COMUKMARFOR

Commodore Cunningham, the previous COMUKCSG, flew his flag throughout the January to May Orion '08 deployment, as Commander Task Group 328.01,[13] which included exercises with the Indian Navy, aboard HMS Illustrious.

The Naval Task Group for Operation VELA, a three month deployment to West Africa in 2006, was under the command of Commander UK Amphibious Group, Commodore Phil Jones. The VELA deployment involved a significant number of Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, the Royal Marine Commandos and helicopters.[14] The Task Group included HMS Albion, HMS Ocean, HMS Southampton, HMS Argyll, RFA Wave Knight, RFA Mounts Bay, RFA Sir Bedivere, RFA Fort Austin, HMS Enterprise, RFA Diligence, RFA Oakleaf, Mine Counter Measure Squadron 1 and a Fleet submarine together with the Fleet Lead Commando Group, consisting of 40 Commando Royal Marines, 59 Commando Independent Engineering Squadron, 29 Commando Royal Artillery and 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines. Also involved were elements of Fleet Diving Unit 2 and 849 (B) Flight from RNAS Culdrose. Embarked in HMS Ocean for the deployment a Tailored Air Group (TAG) was formed, consisting of Sea King helicopters of 845 Naval Air Squadron, 846 Naval Air Squadron, Merlin Mk 1 aircraft from 820 Naval Air Squadron and Lynx helicopters of 847 Naval Air Squadron. The Vela task group conducted an amphibious exercise, Exercise Green Eagle, in Sierra Leone.

Task Groups despatched to the Far East since 2003 have included deployments in 2003, 2004, and 2005. In 2003, Naval Task Group 03 had been intended to take part in FPDA exercises in the Asia-Pacific region but was diverted for involvement in the 2003 Iraq War. Eventually part of the Naval Task Group including Liverpool, Marlborough and RFA Grey Rover departed Gulf waters, after the intervention phase of the Iraq War (2003), en route for Exercise Flying Fish, with Commonwealth-partners and members of the Five Power Defence Arrangements which are the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. In 2004, Exeter, Echo, RFA Diligence and RFA Grey Rover visited the Asia-Pacific region. In 2005, Liverpool, with RFA Grey Rover, made such a deployment.

2 weeks of interactions summarizes my 5 years of contributions. Interesting. I do not like thugs. BMK and APK are just that, in the style of editing that each chooses to use. Both are keen on the rules, as long as the rule at that moment applies to them, I.E. Be Bold allows BMK to change any photo he wants and allows him, to craft in moments a consensus, with his posse behind him. What I found amusing about that user is his ref to WP:DIVA, yet when you read DIVA, it really should a lot like how he handles himself here. His POV is the ONLY POV that matters and his passive aggressive POV pushing, dominates the topics he edits, and the user refuses to obtain unbiased comments from others as was noted in this edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJersey_City%2C_New_Jersey&diff;=641043036&oldid;=641042701 Beyond My Ken, pretends to want others to offer insight as long as he can posture his POV by dissuading from voting on anything I contribute, and talking himself into thinking that other support his POV, 5 minutes later then just executing the edit. That is not a consensus, that is a dictator and abusive way to control and dominate anything he decides to Dominate. Epicgenius, NeilN, Castncoot, are followers for the most part. I think it is really funny that Epicgenius was the one that selected the Manhattan photo for the lead on that page, then goes back and tells me """"do not replace lead photos anymore"""", but I guess it is still ok for them to do so, without any substantiation of the contributions. I do not think that """"Epicgenius"""" knows what he is doing here yet, and his talk page somewhat supports that assertion. Castncoot like a picture of a bridge for the lead photo of a city, as that bridge is """"Iconic"""" in spite of the fact that icons are not cities, my contribution was to create a page that was about the topic city, not leading with the bridge that gets you there. The photo I changed out was actually the real city, not the bridge going to it. After over 5 years, I have had only a few run ins with other editors. I have hundreds of lead photos and a number of Featured ones too. I have been bold in my editing, as BMK claims that allows him to dominate topics, and 99% of my photos are NEVER removed or replaced until someone decides to go off the deep end, as BMK and APK did here. lastly aerial photography is highly valued and extremely difficult, as the collective combination of skills required is overwhelming at times. No other editor on this site has contributed the type of content that I used to submit. Now that BMK has made it clear that he will stalk my edits and revert any photographic contribution I make, what is the point of continuing other then to just edit stories here, as I have for years and perhaps Wikipedia can one day find another aerial photographer that is willing to donate to the site. We will see. talk→    """

147495,"""==Why I don't edit often anymore==

Back in the day I used to edit wikipedia on a fairly regular basis. One of the pages I edited was the eXile. One detractor of the eXile, Peter Ekman, was so pathologically obsessed with discrediting the periodical, that he would devote weeks at a time to blanking and otherwise vandalizing the eXile article while launching reckless accusations at everyone who """"defended"""" the eXile. Although many editors did our best to contain Mr. Ekman, eventually he wore me down. It just wasn't worth it spending my free time containing the vendetta of some aggrieved middle-aged jerk.

As a parting bow in my too-long Ekman drama, I wanted to post here a summary about Mr. Ekman's character and the original wiki text that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade.

About Peter Ekman

Peter Ekman is the aforementioned hack journalist who crusaded against the eXile. But once upon a time Ekman actually had an impressive sounding job working as an editor for the Moscow Times and dispensing right-wing platitudes in the heart of the former communist empire. Moscow in the 90s was a place where failures didn't fail. And for a long time Ekman didn't fail, despite his total lack of social graces and limited intelligence. Eventually his columns attracted the ire of the fellow Moscow publication, the eXile.

Originally the eXile was planning only on criticizing Ekman's written work, but Ekman's response was righteous, menacing, and hinted at violence. So the eXile's added a personal detail: they included the account of a female employee who had been subjected to unwelcome sexual advances by Mr. Ekman. Mr. Ekman had groped the employee while inviting her to a weekend get-away while his Russian Bride was out of town. Ekman responded with the same witless ape-shit animosity that I have since personally witnessed many times on wikipedia. Ekman attempted to get the eXile banned from Johnson's Reading List by declaring the eXile was a fascist, neo-nazi periodical. Ekman's evidence for such nazi sympathies was a spoof fashion piece entitled """"The eXile's Third Reich Uniform of the Week,"""" in which a fictional gay fashion designer breathlessly reviewed the 1938 version of the Nazi Field Bishop uniform.

Eventually Ekman lost his position at the Moscow Times. Since then he's occasionally surfaced as a professor of finance at various 3rd rate universities and, of course, here on Wikipedia.

The following is an excerpt from the Wikipedia Article on the eXile that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade:

Peter Ekman, Johnson's Russia List, and an Unsubtantiated Groping Allegation
In November 2000, in Issue #23 of The eXile, Matt Taibbi published a press review entitled Peter Ekman Groped Me.  The article ridiculed Ekman, then newly appointed editor of The Moscow Times, for his approach to the economic and political development of Russia.  Taibbi characterized this approach as high-handed, condescending, and arrogant, and went on to mock Ekman personally as a pompous hypocrite: """"Ekman has only one idea (""""Russia has a lot to learn from America""""), which he tries endlessly to sell and resell as a varied package of ribald wit and insight.""""  The article also ridiculed Ekman for describing himself as a """"financial educator,"""" and described him as having """"a head seemingly worn bald from improper use.""""  As a finishing touch, Taibbi recounted an as-yet unverified account of sexual advances made by Ekman to an eXile employee, made at late at night at the Garazh nightclub in Moscow during a visit from Ekman's mother-in-law.

Ekman responded by writing in to Johnson's Russia List to claim that """"the eXile is fascist and racist,""""  that """"every eXile issue contains unverifiable stories that smear someone's reputation,"""" that The eXile """"is associated with the fascist party of Eduard Limonov."""" The accusations of fascism were discounted by many in part because of the eXile's Jewish roots - Ames, along with the eXile's publisher, deputy editor and several contributors are all Jews - and because of the paper's satirical editorial bent. It remains unclear as to whether Ekman did in fact make advances toward an eXile employee, or who that employee may have been.

 stradbroke galleon etc 

Hallo Hesperian
Just thought I should send you a copy of my comments on the end of your little witch hunt. Yes you won, bully for you, I hope it makes you feel like a big man. I look forward to when I bump into you in the flesh so we can sort this out the old fashioned way; face to face. that will be fun!!!

hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by """"mainstream"""" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the """"mainstream"""" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails. Gregjay (talk)

WTF are you talking about?  There is no admin decision against me to not edit gender articles.  I'm full allowed to edit any and all articles.  Not only are you engaging in slanderous accusations, you're telling flat out lies.  I'd say spreading flat out lies which have absolutely not basis in reality against other members is a violation of several Wikipedia policies, so you better be VERY careful about what you say.  I strongly suggest that you retract your slanderous accusation before you further discredit yourself.Why the heck would I make changes under an alternate account when I have the full capability of doing it under this account?  

Also, where have I inserted any kind of right wing or religious views here?  Nothing I've said has anything to do with religion nor does it have anything to do with politics.  My points are extremely valid and you only rejected them because of your ridiculous personal biases and need to push your POV.  Not only are transvestites not necessarily transgendered, there are quite a few people on this list who are clearly NOT transvestites even using the description given in the article itself.  I have to question how anyone thought it was a good idea to add them.  

I should also note that you're being hypocritical here, you're reverting a change on the basis that it hasn't been discussed, when you yourself refuse to discuss it!  I'd be very interested to know why a) non-transgendered people should be included on a list of transgendered ones and b) why transvestite is used as automatic criteria for seeing if someone is transgendered, even though there is nothing in the definition that indicates that.

Frankly, this kind of behavior is appalling.  The supposedly open minded LGBT Wikipedian cliques criticize """"right wing religious"""" people (and by right-wing religious that means anyone who doesn't agree with their extremist views) is actually one of the most close-minded groups on wikipedia, with the least likely chance of actually discussing things (as evidenced here) and least likely to consider others views.   29 June 2005 22:08 (UTC)"""

Thank you for responding. When a crime has been committed, the last thing you want is for the perpetrators to benefit from the crime. The most important action to be taken is that of restoring the damage that was done through the use of illegal activity. In a civil society, concerns of punishment are secondary to that of fixing the problem.

In this case, User:Chaosfeary has been punished with a 72 hour block that could become indefinite, but the damage he did has not been reversed. By punishing the user while allowing the crime to continue, we are telling editors that they can ignore the rules at Wikipedia in any heavy handed way they want and that, even if they are caught, the results of their criminal activity will remain.

In this case, we can undo the damage simply by restoring the """"American terrorism"""" article.

I agree to some of your claims and appreciate your suggestions but I would like to point out that you have removed literally all statistics and some of them are clearly appropriate.

I do agree with the picky statistics, and removed comparisons in industrial outputs. For all comparisons made, I included reason why it is made, so it is made clear that it is not a POV. Some of your claims are vague, such as """"due to its healthy manufacturing base"""", which clearly points to original research. You have also removed the IMF forecasts without a valid reason, which is clearly appropriate to show where S Korea is heading right now and useful in demonstrating the speed at which it is growing. I do agree to the technology section and removed some comparisons. My point is that you can't remove all the statistics just because you/or some Wikipedia readers think it is making comparisons - achievements should be recognized and the best way to do so is through comparison.

At the top of this section Funkynusayri said """"this article should rather be called Nordic race with Nordic supremacy theory as a sub-section of it"""". That's not an objection to merging, it's an argument in favour of merging, with one aspect contained within another in the same article. We all know that there was historical concept of a 'Nordic race'. No-one disputes that. The question is whether there is any point having a separate article about it, distinct from the cultural and ideological uses to which it has been put. If both can managably be contained in the same article, then they should be. The Mediterranean race article contains both aspects, and so should this one. The title is rather a separate question. Nordic theory is a name that was created by user:fastfission to merge the term Nordic race with the idea that the concept became historically significant because there were specific theories about it. After all, that's what makes this page different from the others. This topic has a long, sometimes acrimonious, Talk page. If you look up Mediterranean race there is far less discussion, and there is almost none on Alpine race or Dinaric race. I don't mind what the title is, but the difference in title does reflect the reality that theories about this issue have been historically and ideologically significant, while theories about other European """"sub-races"""" have been purely academic.

 2 items of work on the """"making the case"""" section 

The discussion immediately above (regarding how to incorporate Obama's presidential re-election statements regarding the jobs bill) and how we do it.

Making the case
President Obama appeared before constituents of Eric Cantor's congressional district to press the Congress to pass his bill immediately. On September 12, he gave a speech in the White House Rose Garden in front of a group of teachers, police officers, construction workers and small-business owners in which he stated that """"if Congress does not act, just about every family in America will pay more taxes next year. That would be a self-inflicted wound that our economy just cannot afford right now."""" In Speaker Boehner's home state of Ohio, Obama gave a speech described as """"fiery"""" in a Columbus high school that led to the audience chanting: """"Pass this bill!"""" In a campaign-style rally at North Carolina State University, Obama told college students """"Every single one of you can help make this bill a reality. … The time for hand-wringing is over. The time for moping around is over. We've got to kick off our bedroom slippers and put on our marching shoes."""" At a black-tie dinner for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, Obama pitched his jobs plan to Latinos. In anticipation of criticism that the legislation was motivated by the upcoming election, the President noted that the election is fourteen months away and that Americans do not have the luxury of waiting fourteen months for jobs to be created.

Re item #1 I propose we tack it onto the very end of the paragraph with a sentence like """"Some of the criticism refers to Obama's own remarks, including past statements that he will (blank blank blank)"""" (I won't complete the sentence, but just letting you overlook my generalized proposal.) We could even take off the final sentence that is there now, and I could incorporate via some other measure. I'm a very good writer, and don't want to over-invest before I get more feedback at this point. 
As an aside, I plan to do some work Tuesday to help explain the backstory to the """"Related bill"""" section, because it fails to tell the reader the funny story (i.e. that a witty republican thought he could steal the """"antecedent"""" referred to by Obama's """"pronoun"""" because Obama was saying to pass a bill which had not yet been trademarked, so that witty republican guy trademarked the patent before Obama's people could register the name). That will require a better source than just newser and the daily caller. That will be Tuesday's work, so I just wanted to tip my hat off on what's next.

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Vandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia. The most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor, page blanking, or the insertion of nonsense into articles.

Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated. Not all vandalism is obvious, nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. Careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial, detrimental but well intended, or outright vandalism.

Committing blatant vandalism violates Wikipedia policy. If you find that another user has vandalized Wikipedia, you should revert the changes and warn the user (see below for specific instructions). Users who vandalize Wikipedia repeatedly, despite warnings to stop, should be reported to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism, and administrators may block them."

 classical optics part 2 

i hate to say this but i think everyone has completely misunderstood what i am tryint to do.

i am just trying to give a clear picture to the reader of the beginings and then move on to the other sections, i have no intention at all of changing the structure of the article. the article begins very clearly with the """"classical optics"""" part that describes how light was considered before the wave model. the problem our current presentation is that the wave model is right in the begining, this is a bit strange.

that is why i arranged the article such that you had the classical optics and its further explanation in geometrical optics, then wave modeln then comparison to quantum optics and finally modern optics. in other words nothing in the article changed except for the position.
copper i feel that in the sources you have shown they are considering classical optics as the entire thing which is both the particle and wave model. however what i am doing is showing the beginning of optics. there are other google hits that take classical optics purely as the earlier concepts before the introduction of wave model but anyway there is no point of going through them and listing them. one google book on fourier optics does not mention the word """"electromagnetism"""" till page 365! different terminology i guess. anyway 

i feel that we cant put the wave model in the beginning, it just would not make any sense. its like we are skipping everything and landing on maxwells equations which happened much later. the current form is ok. 

it follows a good pattern - classical, geometrical, wave model, comparison with quantum optics finally modern optics."""

 Incipit - definition of L. Baeck as """"assimilated Jew"""" 

The statement """"Baeck represented the modern assimilated Central European Jew"""" is misleading; 
Baeck, undisputed moral and political leader of the German Jewry in Nazi Germany and 
president of the Reichsvertretung der deutschen Juden („Reich’s Deputation of the German 
Jews“), cannot be labeled as an „assimilated jew“.

From a sociological point of view, an authoritative definition that resumes the current 
research stand on the phenomenon of assimilation can be founded in 
J. Milton Yinger: Toward a Theory of Assimilation and Dissimilation. In: Ethnic and Racial 
Studies. Volume 4 Number 3, July 1981, p. 249-264, already quoted in the german-speaking 
Wikipedia article about assimilation (http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assimilation_%28Soziologie%29, 16.09.2012). 
Here a quote from Yinger 1981, p. 249  „Assimilation is a process of boundary reduction, 
that can occur when members of two or more societies or of smaller cultural groups meet. 
Seen as a complete process, it is the blending into one of formerly distinguishable 
socio-cultural groups“ 

In the Jewish Virtual Library, „assimilation“ is described with relation to jewish modern 
history as „the sociocultural process in which the sense and consciousness of association 
with one national and cultural group changes to identification with another such group, 
so that the merged individual or group may partially or totally lose its original 
national identity“
(http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01522.html, 16.09.2012)

The definition of Baeck as an „assimilated Jew“ represents a misunderstanding of his 
commitment to liberalism and integration and as such should be removed.

The chances of two different people on the same IP (meaning at the same computer) knowing enough of Wiki internals to: go poking around ANI, try to run for ArbCom, request a block for an admin, and then have troll unblock requests (""""hello"""" is not a spurious unblock request, really?), is just too small for my liking.  I'm sorry if I'm not going to AGF that, but I cannot suspend my disbelief that far, and I got hammered for it.  

I neither expect nor require an apology, but I do want it to be known that something important was missed in that thread, and that IP's going to be a problem until someone takes care of it.   """

No, actually, we're not here for the same reason.  I don't have a lot of experience with Wikipedia, and I'm not here to do lots of work on Wikipedia, and I don't read their policies (would take too much time - not really interested - I'm an armchair reader/editor of Wikipedia).  What I find with Wikipedia these days, is, to find out some detail/meat on a subject, one has to go to the edits and look at stuff that has been deleted.  There seems to be a huge effort by people to delete stuff on subjects they know nothing about.  I just got through going around in circles with a guy (I think he was also a Wikipedia administrator) where he deleted all sorts of stuff from the bio of Anthony Senter (a convicted Lucchese/Gambino mobster doing life for multiple murders).  The whole bio was taken from a well-known book called """"Murder Machine"""" and it was referenced at the bottom under """"References"""", but this guy wanted everything deleted if it didn't have a citation at the end of each sentence.  I had to tell him that the entire article came from that one book (and it's a good book, written by a well-known NY crime reporter).  What the guy/administrator should have done is first known the subject matter then edit - that way, he would have known that the whole thing was in fact already referenced at the bottom.  I tried putting in a few links but I couldn't get them to work (somebody else fixed them).  It's really too much work to go around and around in circles with these guys (they seem to be """"busybodies"""") as they delete and delete and delete, when in fact the items are either (1) well known to anybody that knows the subject matter (like Conrad's friendship with Spilotro), or (2) they are very easily found.  The way you are running things here at Wikipedia, the only entries will be made by administrators like yourself who know Wikipedia's syntax, etc.  You will either not get edits from people like me, or, if you do, they will be deleted.

According to some versions, both articles began with a paragraph about the hero.  This is not how I remember it.  
The first paragraph of Virgin birth (mythology), about 'the statement that because mythological births were not virgin births they have no relation to the Christian story' (not the exact words) was already in the first paragraph of the unfinished Virgin birth (mythology).  The finished wording may be awkward, but it is only because I try to keep material that others contributed, rather than delete it.  However, the original paragraph avoided mentioning that there are sources which show a long-standing tradition of comparison, and the strict definition of a virgin birth has been no hindrance to this tradition.  In the past, the virgin birth part hasn't shut down the whole comparison, as was attempted in the original material of Virgin birth (mythology)."

Confusion
I was looking through this article and some links it points to, and noticed the following oddity:
On this page, EM radiation is distinguished from particle radiation, while it is claimed that particle radiation is made of moving subatomic particles.  Thing is, a photon is such a particle.  In fact, if you follow the link to the article about particle radiation, you'll notice that a photon is, in fact, on the list of particles there!  Therefore, it would appear that EM radiation is, in fact, a sort of particle radiation.
Being no expert on physics myself, I can only assume that it was meant that particle radiation is made of particles other than photons, i.e. ones that don't display particle/wave duality.  If so, I'd say that should be expressed more clearly.  Either way, either this page, or the one on particle radiation, should definitely be changed somehow to deal with this confusion.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 89.138.227.172  00:46, August 30, 2007 (UTC)

 Copyright issues report 

Hi, I've mentioned the copyright problems here. Any help you can give in removing material that you know you've copy-pasted, and then noting that it's been removed, would be appreciated.  (talk) 
I doubt anyone would want you to quit (I know I don't!), but it is very important that you respect copyrights.  IMHO, nothing is a bigger threat to the continued success of Wikipedia than copyvios.  The potential for the foundation to get sued is far bigger than it is for libel by far.  I have been screamed at, told off and generally put in my place dozens of time since I have been here and fully expect that I will again, many times.  It would be really nice if everyone here was kind and respectful, but, just like society in general, that just isn't the case.  My suggestion to you is to ask questions, get help when you need it, make friends and continue to work on articles you like.  The best thing I did after I got here was to get adopted.  There is no textbook for this, and adoption provides you with a teacher that will walk you through the ropes, and be around after you graduate to mentor you.  Another great thing here is the Teahouse.  It is a place especially for newer users to ask questions and get answers without attitude.  My dad always used to say that the only stupid question was the one you didn't ask, and the Teahouse definitively follows that credo.  I will leave you an invite after this message.  I will also be happy to help you in any way I can.  Just drop a note on my talk page.  Welcome to Wikipedia, and happy editing!

I think this is just a bit silly that you can't see your own biases. Why can't you see your own biases? Or had you considered the fact a good majority of Wikipedia editors share a Left of center POV by Jimmy Wales' own admission? The bias is hardly in a conservative direction, or even neutral. How can you say there isn't a decided hostility to conservative or traditional points of view on Wikipedia
Wikipedia's NPOV rule is meaningless, considering this fact. Explain to me why you think my observation of fact is absurd? Wikipedia isn't a reliable source because this fact, and if you hadn't been reading students in colleges in America, at least, are discouraged from citing it because of serious factual errors and political biases that pass for the truth. 
The problem here IS NOT with me.  
Guy, I wish you could see how the world views Wikipedia, and it's not good. Wikipedia's NPOV rule is symbolic, and from what I have seen no one here follows it. I have read all of the rules,and I have made every effort to follow them. Do everyone a favor and declare that Wikipedia is a Left-wing site. e.g.,  a blog. It comes down to an ideosyncratic application of the rules to fit your worldviews.
FM writes for the Democratic Underground, Jim68sch has confessed to having Marxist sentiments and you have confessed to being sympathetic to homosexuality. So, how can you say that there isn't a Left of center bias on Wikipedia?  I am mentioning the fact I Googled FM's handle, and found posts under his handle on the decidedly Liberal/Socialist Democratic Underground because it shows where his political biases lay.
How then can he be anymore objective than I?
FM said I weakened his viewpoint that Dominionism was a threat or a problem by adding the viewpoints of self-professed Christian Reconstructionists to the Dominionism article. How can you say that he's neutral anymore than I am neutral. My beef with that particular article is that it seems to stereotype all conservative American Christians as wanting to replace the U.S. Constitution with a neo-Puritan theocracy. 
Wikipedia lacks the same quality as Encyclopedia Britannica when it comes to maintaining a non-partisan perspective?
I consider myself knowledgeable about the Christian right, at least the Catholic faction therof, and I object to what I see as the blatant stereotyping of conservative Christians. The fact Chip Berlet or Katherine Yurica are considered """"experts"""" furthers my perception of bias. Mr. Berlet, I will concede, is more factual than say Ms. Yurica, but he paints with a very broad brush that ignores the diversity of the Christian right.
Their writings are riddled with strawman attacks, guilt by association, glaring generalizations, etc. The series of articles on """"Dominionism"""" are riddled with factual errors and POV. Is it NPOV to limit the content to a single POV where only those who share a single POV are granted """"expert"""" status?
I will leave Wikipedia alone for awhile, and perhaps limit myself to editing on the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox-oriented pages. When it comes to politics, Wikipedia is of limited informative value.

Well, not that i don't appreciate what you said, but even so, allow me to reply. 

Today there were the funerals of Enzo Biagi, a freeman as few remains in a world more and more without any respect for freedom (seen as a 'threat for the established order'). The oil price is flying to 100$ and this should led to think more seriously to our absurd world. But let's go:

1-there is someone that is costantly pointed at the 'words' while others are pointed on 'facts'. Since you call my comment 'above' as non-polite, obviously you miss why i could be not friendly with someone that not miss a time to complain in Arbcom every time we discuss in any sense. This is 'polite' and wikilove for you? To me it not looks so. Since i am a volonteer here, not payed (as all the collaborators as well), you cannot pretent i act like all the conformists here have established, and obey to Bzuk or BillCJ every time saying 'yes master, yes master, like you want master'. And surely i wouldn't take EH as 'bright example'. Sorry, the manner in which they acted not displays any reasonable friendly-acting. So it's hard pretend to me to be so kind with gentlemen that not even bothers to explain why they does this and that revert.

2-Another thing that show dramatically well some things: 

Take for instance, the first paragraph after the header """"Technical description""""...the paragraph ends with the sentence """"the only real all-around fighter that served in AMI, but this was not without limitation in every task."""" That's a very subjective statement, and, since it's making a judgement, it really needs a citation so that the reader can understand what the source of that statement is. As it stands right now, however, because it is not cited, it merely looks like opinion on your part, which would be right to remove/revert.

All the G.91R page explains continuosly why this plane was 'limited' and 'mainly successful as recce'. I cannot understand how this thing, considering all the datas and stuff given, can be 'questioned'. Rather than criticize me just try to get a look about the JAS-39 Gripen. 

Basically, questioning this fact shows apalling comprension for all the article, because it's a statement well placed inside the meaning of this work.

3-Washing your hands and not bother about to collaborate with me is not surely a 'nice' manner to do. Strangely enough, this is 'justified', rather than be a guilth. So, basically, every thing i do or not do is wrong, while every thing you do or not do is right. With these bases, expecting a costructive dialogue is just funny. You have been 'offensed' by the vanification of F-104S adjustements (because i after done some more contr.). This is the only thing you did in over a month of 'collaboration'. Too easy, my dear, to self justify all times like you. Easy not bothering to collaborate, while the guilth is mine that already lost my time to contribue gratis to this ency.

4-My contributions should be alway quoted here and that. But being serious, there are a lot of pages without any or almost any references. I dont' understand why i should be whipped to post 500 kb. The issue about F-86 data touched the buttom of the sea and dig it too. I cannot cope with someone that not even read online sources with absurd reasons.

5-The continuos accuses, diffamations and so on about me are not liked either. Perhaps the problem is that Wikipedia takes herself too seriously in the last times? Perhaps that be called 'traitor' or 'harmer' is not friendly? Obviously you rate these accusation as 'righful critics'. But not i.

I remember very well that you accused me without any proof to make copyviols, even with funny interpretations of Goebel PD text (that i stated as not mine, the only time i used other texts in all the MB written for the sake of Wiki). I wouldn't have a judge like you in the real world, believe me.

6-The fantastic wikioz world, 'tooooo perfect' to be 'questioned'. But to me and some others, this looks not exactly true. There are a lot of burocrats, hipocrites and trolls, or simply there are a lot of guys that basically fears the others and are ready to 'defend the Revolution' with zealot fanatism. Questioning even the basical celebral activity and even the basical freedom of spreech, questioning even the simply syllogism. 

All this is due because, as always in these cases, from French revolution today there are always many 'revolutionary guards' ready to show their 'loyalty' to the 'cause'. So wikipedia prefers executes guys 'out of the chor' instead to admit to have some 'contradictions'. This is the usual manner to act. And i have no love to who call me 'wiki.harmer' just because i show that i 'know' my stuff, not only 'have read it somewhere'. This is why Goebel and many others keeps away from"
82322,"Links 

I've removed a majority of the links from the law page but I think it to explain why. First, this page is about the general concept of law as a social construct, it is not about the particular law of any country and so it should not have country specific links. Those links should be put in the article of the laws of the particular country, not here. Second, the page is not indended to be a repository of useful law links. So just because it was useful useful site does not warrant inclusion. Rather, a link should aid in the understanding of the content of the article, most of them did not. The proliferation of legal dictionaries, news websites, lawyer indices, and other such websites was getting out of control. There is no shortage of these sorts of websites on the internet and none of them are all that distinguishable or authoritative. There was really no good reason to have them."

 Date of move for Beethoven's and Schubert's final resting place. 

Dear MagicPiano,
In the 1863 edition of the British publication """"The Musical Standard"""", the following paragraph is found on page 108 of the November issue. It appears that this sets the move date of the bodies earlier than the 1888 year given in the article.  Or perhaps there were two moves?? It doesn't seem likely.

(I have copied the paragraph digitized by The Google Book project and OCR'd the image, and then checked it for errors.)

MUSICAL SACRILEGE.—The following paragraph has been going the round of the daily papers, appearing in the Globe under the head of Court Intelligence: (!)—""""The Musical Society of Vienna having resolved that the mortal remains of Beethoven and of Schu-bert should be placed in more suitable vaults, the two bodies were exhumed on the 13th in the presence of a crowd of medical and artistic notabilities (!). The skeleton of Beethoven was almost perfect, the bone of the temples alone being wanting. The remains of Schubert had suffered much: the head and hair were intact. The bodies of the celebrated composers were photographed (!) upon being reburied.""""
[There is something essentially repulsive in the idea of disturbing the remains of Beethoven """"in the presence of a crowd of artistic —nobodies;—a proceeding not at all divested of culpably impertinent curiosity by the plea of reverence to the memory of the departed great.—ED.]

Well, I said I am flexible, but I think you are way out of line with the article. For a long time the article stood on its legs because I, as Entwistle's biographer (the book is on its way), VERIFIED the sources. For example (and I'm only going to give two for now), you deleted the entry mentioning her signing the RKO contract on June 13....I HAVE THE CONTRACT IN FRONT OF ME! I'd be happy to send you a scan of it. At the top it says, """"This agreement made this 13th Day of June, 1932, between RKO Studios and Peg Entwistle."""" It is signed by Entwistle, David O. Selznick, and Daniel L. Oshea, Selnick's Assistant Secretary. Then you added that Entwistle played in bit parts in several films (I'm paraphrasing), and referenced a source. But this claim of bit parts in other films proved to be untrue when I researched the entire body of RKO's inter-office memos at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences archives in the Herrick Library in Beverly Hills. (I have copies of all the Selznick and Cukor memos regarding """"Thirteen Women,"""" and other possible Peg Entwistle-related projects (such as discussions regarding Billie Burke wanting Peg instead of Katherine Hepburn in """"Bill of Divorcement.""""

I tried to be polite and respectful and reasonable, but it turns out that you are entirely unwilling to discuss anything with regard my expertise into the career and life and death of Peg Entwistle before """"tweaking"""" her Wiki.

Entwistle's familynamely her brother Milton Entwistle and his daughterfurnished me with hundreds of documents including diaries, letters, and telegrams. Before I met them I spent 5 years researching her careerliterally reading the era's newspapers and theatrical-related periodicals a page at a time. I spent hundreds of hours doing interviews. I found Entwistle doing radio in 1925, having lunch at the White House in 1931, being black mailed, and a dozen other things no onenot even her family had known. And because of her family's cooperation, I was able to complete a timeline that other authors had never before been able to string together. EVERYTHING I discovered has at least two verifiable, reliable sources.

 The McIntosh et al. 2013 study on rotational acceleration and bicycle helmets 

I have restored the reference to this study in the """"Rotational Injury"""" section of the article - someone had removed it and substituted a reference to a another study by McIntosh et al. which deals only with motorcycle helmets. Unfortunately, it seems the publisher has made a mistake and the McIntosh et al. paper and one other paper are missing from the online journal contents (you can see the gap in the page numbers for that issue). The corresponding author is endeavouring to have that corrected, but the paper does exist, I have seen a copy of it. It isn't indexed in PubMed yet either.  In the meantime, I will post of a copy of the abstract from the paper here:
ANDREW S. MCINTOSH, ADRIAN LAI and EDGAR SCHILTER. Bicycle Helmets: Head Impact Dynamics in Helmeted and Unhelmeted Oblique Impact Tests. Traffic Injury Prevention (2013) 14, 501–508. online DOI: 10.1080/15389588.2012.727217. 
Objective: To assess the factors, including helmet use, that contribute to head linear and angular acceleration in bicycle crash simulation tests.
Method: A series of laboratory tests was undertaken using an oblique impact rig. The impact rig included a drop assembly with a Hybrid III head and neck. The head struck a horizontally moving striker plate. Head linear and angular acceleration and striker plate force were measured. The Head Injury Criterion was derived. The following test parameters were varied: drop height to a maximum of 1.5 m, horizontal speed to a maximum of 25 km/h, helmet/no helmet, impact orientation/location, and restraint adjustment. Additional radial impacts were conducted on the same helmet models for comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics were derived and multiple regression was applied to examine the role of each parameter. 
Results: Helmet use was the most significant factor in reducing the magnitude of all outcome variables. Linear acceleration and the Head Injury Criterion were influenced by the drop height, whereas angular acceleration tended to be influenced by the horizontal speed and impact orientation/location. The restraint adjustment influenced the outcome variables, with lower coefficients of variation observed with the tight restraint. 
Conclusions: The study reinforces the benefits of wearing a bicycle helmet in a crash. The study also demonstrates that helmets do not increase angular head acceleration. The study assists in establishing the need for an agreed-upon international oblique helmet test as well as the boundary conditions for oblique helmet testing.

a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,

THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

Hi  -  Thanks for the greeting - A Happy Diwali to you too!!  

 Greetings 
Thank you for your recent contributions to one of Wikipedia's Uruguay-related articles. Given the interest you've expressed by your edits, have you considered joining the Uruguay WikiProject? It's a group dedicated to improving the overall quality of all Uruguay-related articles. 

If you have any questions, see the help pages, ask at the Uruguay project talk page, or feel free to ask me on

Sure, I would be happy to. - 

 Casapueblo 
Gracias por mejorar el artículo de Casapueblo que increiblemente no estaba en wikipedia. Yo que no soy uruguayo,  creo que este lugar es uno de los más mágicos en el mundo!.
Próximamente subiré algunas fotos tomadas por mí,  pero por favor avisale al WikiProject de Uruguay que no olviden pegarse una pasada y mejorarlo aun más.

Tambien me di cuenta que no existe artículo sobre Paez Vilaró, para que lo incluyan el la lista """"por hacer"""".
En cuanto pueda subiré más fotos de Casapueblo y de Uruguay.

Hola ! Thank you for your nice note. I regret to say that I do not read Spanish so I had a friend translate your note for me... I think that you raise many good points - why don't you join the Uruguay WikiProject? Perhaps then you could create the article on Paez Vilaró? Also, don't forget to review these guidelines: Wikipedia:Image use policy - before uploading images to the pages. I look forward to reading your future contributions to the Casapueblo page ...

WP:FU violation

Your recent edit to Aishwarya Rai has been reverted.  We are not permitted to use fair-use images to depict living people.  Additionally, you did not add the mandatory detailed fair-use rationale justifying the use of that image.  Please see WP:FU which explains this policy.  Thanks.   
 My apologies - since the image was used on the film page for Bride and Prejudice, I thought it was within fair use. Thanks for the information - - 
Also please note that it was the original poster of the image who did not add the """"mandatory detailed fair-use rationale justifying the use of that image."""" - 
Well, the fair-use rationale must be added for each use of the image, so given that you were adding it to a new article, you would have to add it.  But that's not particularly important here, as the image was unusable.  Please don't think that I'm coming down hard on you, though.  Most people are not aware that only freely-licensed images can be used to depict living people and every editor runs foul of some of the policies from time to time.  Have a good day!

Hitler was quite right when he said that Admiral Graf Spee should have won the battle. She lost because of errors made by captain Langsdorff. Graf Spee outgunned all her opponents, having 11 inch main guns, to Exeters 8 inch and Ajax and Achilles 6 inch guns.

Langsdorff should have concentrated the fire on Exeter first before Admiral Graf Spee came into the range of the light cruisers.

Instead, Langsdorff split his fire between the three targets, with the result that although Exeter was severely damaged and forced to withdraw, the other ships got into range and scored 20 hits on Admiral Graf Spee, including on the food stores and bakeries."""

I'll confess to being a bit lost among these theological discussions. I can say that we should include all significant points of view, even Geaves'. If some say that Rawat had a Sant Mat lineage, while other say he had an Advait Mat or Radhasoami lineage, then all of those views should be included, in proportion to their prominence, and we shouldn't take sides either directly or by implication. Note that each of those linked topics has an article of its own, so we don't need to discuss them at length in this article. Anything we do say about them should be relevant to Rawat himself. 
More broadly, I'd remind everyone that we have an entire article devoted to Rawat's teachings, Teachings of Prem Rawat. The material in this article should simply be a summary of that article. Since the introductory section of that article should also summarize that article, in an ideal world we could simply copy to the intro here as a summary. Unfortunately, this is not an ideal world.

I smell trouble brewing.  Let's figure this out before an edit war starts.  I see a few issues here in dispute: 
1) Cold-blooded=stockier draft type vs. cold-blooded=origin in cold climates.  I had learned it as the draft-type definition, but I have seen both definitions in use.  I don't necessarily think they are mutually exclusive.  While I think that the geographical terminology likely defined the core original breeds, with years of interbreeding this becomes messy.  So many breeds have differing degrees of both types.  For example, Warmbloods are not the only mixtures of European and Arabian blood.  Wouldn't this strict definition mean that Quarter Horses would be a type of warmblood? My feeling is that we can say something like: """"The hot-blooded/cold-blooded terminology originally related to the geographical origin of the breed, but now has come to refer to the overall character of the horse or pony.""""

2) Ponies (most if not all) are cold-blooded because they originated in cold climates vs. some ponies are cold-blooded because they are draft-type.  Again, I think we can finesse this without saying that one is right or wrong.  I personally think that most ponies are draft-type, and so could be considered cold-blooded, with certain hot-blooded exceptions like the [Hackney pony].  Although, really, come to think of it, lots of ponies are more like little warmbloods...

3) Ponies were not used for 'draft' work in general because they were too small.  As I understand it, some pony breeds flourished at times because they were useful as draft horses in the mines.  For example: """"when the coal mining industry became extensively developed in Britain in the 1800’s, Shetlands were imported in great numbers to haul coal cars in the 'pits'."""" (From """"Shetland Pony"""")

Just my two cents...  """

 Format of quotations 

I've done some copyediting. In particular, there was a problem that a full stop was placed before a footnote, the footnote was added, and another full stop was placed after it. A few quotations had not been closed with quotation marks, etc.

Some quotations have are enclosed in   tags, which seem, according to my eye, to change them into italics but not to do anything else.  I don't see any reason to have some quotations in italics and some not. Actually, I don't see any reason to have any quotations in italics.  We've already had problems (in the Hitler article from which this section comes) with someome putting quotations that implied that Hitler was a fervent Christian in block quotes, and leaving the quotations that implied he was anti-Christian embedded in the text where they wouldn't look so obvious, and later saying that was done according to the length of each quotation (a claim which was refuted by a simple word count). I don't see a pattern in other articles of quotations being in italics.

I'm going to change all of the quotations to plain text (i.e. not italics).  Long quotations can, of course, go in block quotes, regardless of which POV they support. Unrelated to the issue of format is the use of the word """"deplored"""" in the last sentence. I propose changing that to """"rejected"""". """"Deplored"""" suggests shock and anger at the fact that this idea existed, rather than simply rejection of the idea. If I'm mistaken in this (as I don't know whether Hitler condemned the idea that Nazism was a religion, or the the idea that anyone would think it was), please change it back.  ♫ """

 Semi-protected edit request on 24 November 2014 

The article currently states:
There is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of any disease.

There are a few issues with this statement that make it unsuitable:
 An absolute negative is, of course, impossible to prove, and quite a high hurdle to even support reasonably well.
 There are countless examples, including some mentioned in both the cited article and this Wikipedia article, of ways that Ayurvedic treatments have been effective at treating an assortment of diseases.  The cited article includes 5 examples.  (Many statements about the efficacy of Ayurveda concentrate on major disorders.  But, eczema, as one minor example, is a disease which is readily treated by Ayurveda.  So, it may be appropriate to state that there is a lack of evidence showing its efficacy for treating """"certain diseases"""", there is no way to support the claim that there is no scientific evidence as to its effectiveness in treating """"any disease"""".)
 If there were strong evidence supporting the likelihood that """"no scientific evidence"""" existed, then it may be a suitable statement.  But, such an strong statement requires strong support.  The only supporting evidence is one article which is not an academically rigorous source, and which, itself, offers 5 examples of scientific evidence supporting that certain Ayurvedic medicine is effective at treating certain disorders.
 The statement that """"there is no scientific evidence [...]"""" is a claim, and not a supported fact.  For this claim to stand, it should be better supported.  Or, it might better be reworded.

I propose that the above claim be replaced by:
Though some studies suggest the efficacy of some Ayurvedic treatment for certain conditions, the science is inclusive as to the efficacy of Ayurveda as a complete system of treatment.

This statement is supportable and non-controversial.

I may come up with a list of disorders with supporting evidence as to Ayurvedic efficacy to broaden the claim that Ayurvedic treatments have been shown to be effective at treating certain conditions.  However, in the interim, I think there is sufficient cause to remove the claim that there is absolutely none unless such a statement could be at least strongly supported.

 When asked """"Are you an agnostic or an atheist?"""", Russell replied:
Agnostic, of course. Atheists are like Christians: That is, both dogmatically mantain that we can know whether or not there is a God. The Christian holds that God does exist; the atheist holds that God does not. But the agnostic knows that we simply do not possess sufficient grounds either to affirm or deny the existennce of a supreme being. So I believe that although the existence of God is not impossible, it is improbable. Quite improbable.

A more clarifying answer, as mentioned above, can be found in Am I An Atheist Or An Agnostic? (1947), where Russell states:


As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think that I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because, when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.

When the mainstream media characterizes you - Qworty - as a ranting, slanderous, biased editor, then... well, we should take that seriously.  I do hope you've read the Salon article about you?

 Requested move 

Female genital cutting →  – This may be a polarized issue, but most Wikipedia name request changes are. Female genital mutilation is by far the most commonly used term in Academic, Legal, Medical, and Non-Governmental circles, and thus conforms to WP:COMMONNAME. It has been suggested that the current name is an amicable compromise as per WP:NPOV, however this is not a proper implementation of that policy. WP:NPOV is not a trump-card for WP:COMMONNAME for use by those people who for one reason or another disagree with the wording of the most common name. Wikipedia in fact has a policy specifically for pages such as this, WP:POVTITLE, which has not been followed in this case (text included below). Lastly, to keep the current name is to give undue weight (WP:UNDUE) to the people who disagree with the term Female genital mutilation, we must remember that Wikipedia is about what is verifiable and sourced and not what one or more member's opinion on an issue is. There is no debate in the relevant literature over whether female circumcision is in fact mutilation, and Wikipedia should reflect the consensus achieved in verifiable and authoritative sources. 

WP:POVTITLE: """"When a significant majority of English-language reliable sources all refer to the topic or subject of an article by a given name, Wikipedia should follow the sources and use that name as our article title (subject to the other naming criteria). Sometimes that common name will include non-neutral words that Wikipedia normally avoids (Examples include Boston Massacre, Rape of Belgium, and Teapot Dome scandal). In such cases, the commonality of the name overrides our desire to avoid passing judgment (see below). This is acceptable because the non-neutrality and judgment is that of the sources, and not that of Wikipedia editors. True neutrality means we do not impose our opinions over that of the sources, even when our opinion is that the name used by the sources is judgmental.""""   """

When I was skimming over the Powerade bit of the article, I thought what was being conveyed was that they had transitioned some product of there's into an aluminum can, much like energy drinks at packaged, and this was the intended gist of the statement. I didn't really think it over but now that you point it out, yes that is a bit of frivolous information. I'd also agree with you; Powerade isn't an energy drink.

Those are sports drinks, which to my understanding and recollection by common knowledge, are intended to hydrate and provide some salts to athletes. A much different task than the intent of energy drinks.

Capri Sun is just a sugary drink with a fraction of fruit juice; 10% on what I've seen. Though it could different depending on location where it's sold, or what laws dictate toward the content or labeling. The article on Capri Sun has a picture where the product advertises itself as 100% fruit juice. Every capri sun I've every noticed, states it contains 10%.
It may have however amount of juice. It isn't however, an energy drink.
If Capri Sun is an energy drink, then anything containing sugar or corn syrup is an energy drink. The term become basically meaningless. I'm slightly stroking my chin as to who may be placing those products into the article, but I do suppose it could be a mistake in good faith.

Hello.  To Jeffro77 above...  The original and first reference that I put in was Thomas Cahill, and his book The Gifts of the Jews - How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels.   And I originally put that ref alone.  The Wilson ref came later on, from a search, and at the request of Jeppiz.   But Cahill alone I felt was overall sufficient at that point.  (And that Cahill book had literally zero to do with anything with Jehovah’s witnesses, or any JW books or journals or sermons.)    That wasn’t even on my mind in that sense, nor did I look at ANY Watchtower publications regarding this article or this specific matter.  Cahill had nothing to do with that.       And even Jeppiz admitted a number of times that it was a reliable source and ok.       But the Wilson source I provided here later on (and then soon on the article itself) was only at the demand of Jeppiz, for another source.   He kept insisting to find something else, etc, so I did a search, and the Wilson thing was even more pointed in a way, and it’s in a pro-JW website, “strictly genteel”, which transcribed the noted WT book “Is the Bible Really the Word of God?”, and the link can be found here http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/wordofgod/wordofgod4.html.       (Also, to DougWeller, hello.   I’m still not sure why you say that I got the name of the book wrong.   That’s what’s stated as the source.    J.A. Wilson.   And “The World History of the Jewish People”.   At least that’s he main part of the name of the book, and I believe Wilson was a co-author of that or something.)    But, to Jeffro, you seem to think (incorrectly) that I probably had the Wilson ref as paramount, when in actuality that was just a side thing and accident, because of subsequent demands and circumstances on this Talk page.   Cahill was actually my guy on this specific matter on the Exodus matter, NOT Wilson necessarily nearly as much.      The exact (in-context) quote from Cahill’s book says this:   

“When we examine the considerable extant literatures of Mesopotamia and Egypt, we find no obvious mention of the Israelites.  If, as the majority of scholars have provisionally concluded, Israel escaped from Egypt in the reign of Rameses II about midway through the thirteenth century B.C., why is there no record of this marvellous defeat in any Egyptian text or inscription?   Of course, the defeat may have been so embarrassing to Egypt that, like many great powers, it could not allow itself to record honestly what happened.    Alternatively, the story of the drowning of Pharaoh’s army may have been inflated over time by Hebrew oral tradition, and what had been a minor skirmish in Egyptian eyes (we know, for instance, that Ramses II died not in a watery grave but in his bed) was eventually puffed up beyond all recognition.  Most radically:  the Exodus may never have taken place, but may be just a story concocted, like Gilgamesh, by nomadic herdsmen in need of an evening’s entertainment.    This last hypothesis, though temptingly unambiguous, can be maintained only by ignoring  undeniable aspects of the actual text of the Bible.    There are real differences—literary differences, differences of tone and taste, but, far more important, differences of substance and approach to material—between Gilgamesh and Exodus, and even between Gilgamesh and Genesis.""""

Cahill continues:   

""""The anonymous authors of Gilgamesh tell their story in the manner of a myth.  There is no attempt to convince us that anything in the story ever took place in historical time.   At every point, rather, we are reminded that the action is taking place “once upon a time”—in other words, in that pristine Golden Time outside of meaningless earthly time.   The story of Gilgamesh, like the gods themselves, belong to the realm of the stars.   It is meant as a model for the hearers, who believed, in any case, that everything important, everything archeteypal, happened, had happened, was happening—it is impossible to fix this occurrence clearly in one tense, since it occurs outside of time—beyond the earthly realm of unimportant instances.   For all the ancients (except the Israelites, the people who would become the Jews), time as we think of it was unreal; the Real was what was heavenly and archetypal.  For us, the heirs of the Jewish perception, the exact opposite is true:  earthly time is real time; Eternity, if we think of it at all, is the end of time (or simply an illusion).     The text of the Bible is full of clues that the authors are attempting to write history of some sort....But there is in these tales a kind of specificity—a concreteness of detail, a concern to get things right—that convinces us that the writer has no doubt that each of the main events he chronicles happened.”    

He makes it pretty clear that, even though not saying it dogmatically, he does"

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

 claimed bonus points for René Vautier and Nicolas de Fer, articles that did not exist on the English Wikipedia at the start of the year; a first for the WikiCup. The articles were eligible for bonus points because of fact they were both covered on a number of other Wikipedias.

 District of Safed 

Hi, regarding your edit at Dallata.  Because there are quite a few examples of more than one village in Palestine of the same name, we usually identify which district of Palestine it was in (sometimes even in the article name). The unwritten convention among the editors who work on the village articles is to use the 1945-8 districts since that is what most modern sources use.  See Districts of the British Mandate of Palestine, last section, where you will notice that we should be calling them """"sub-districts"""" rather than """"districts"""".  Also, writing that a village was in Mandatory Palestine won't do, since that entity only lasted about 25 years but most of the villages were there for centuries.

Because she already earned a quota in the air pistol, the Olympic slot has been distributed to the runner-up Sandra Uptagrafft of the United States. Granted the athlete has not yet earned a quota for their country means that a quota must be distributed to a different athlete from any country, as long as the NOC has been entitled to a maximum of two shooters per event. In Kiejko's case, she is eligible to compete in the 25 m pistol, but her place must be confirmed by the NOC and ISSF, along with the quota she won in the 10 m pistol. 

 Second, I notice that you added Michel Dion of Canada. Cassio Rippel already won a quota in the 50 m rifle prone. Because Brazil has reserved a place in each of the nine events, and he competes for the host nation, this does not imply that the quota has been distributed to Dion. As per rules on the host country places, these will only be granted in any of the nine places entrusted to the host nation, if it did not obtain any place in that event during the qualification period. With Rippel's victory at the Pan American Games, the host country still keeps a quota in the 50 m rifle prone. If he is confirmed by NOC to compete for the Olympics as long as he obtains the MQS (minimum qualifying score), then the unused host country place will be reallocated to the NOC with the highest MQS that has not yet obtained a quota place or been granted a Tripartite Invitation for the Games.

The wiki article on pediatrics says that this science is relevant to children up to 14 to 21 of age. So how is this specifically relevant to the """"18 years of age"""" point under discussion here? If you want to put in a criticism of Sahaj Marg making younger children meditate, don't hide it in an irrelevant footnote. 
 4. Finally, the sentence """"Sahaj Marg guru recommends a minimum age of 18 before beginning the practice of meditation, implying this technique is not suitable for younger people."""" is your extrapolation of the motivations for the SRCM rules, i.e. original research. Not admissible. I will be removing the """"implying this technique is not suitable for younger people"""" part.

Ethnologue version 14 (valid from 2000 to 2005) contains different information from Ethnologue version 15 (from 2005 onwards). Any person qualified to write on Greece would know that there was no census in Greece in 1986 (they happen every 10 years so the nearest ones were 1981 and 1991) and that the last time """"mother tongue"""" and """"most frequently used language"""" were asked in a Greek census was 1951. The number for the """"mother tongue"""" question (the other number for frequently used language was even smaller) did make it into Ethnologue v.14 but Ethnologue v.15 for reasons that can only be guessed (pretty easily I may add) chose to come up with a fake census and a figure in the 200k region. Anyone that has enough brains to pass a thesis examination for a Ph.D. (as Taivo has) is capable of looking at the differences between Ethnologue v.14 and Ethnologue v.15 and noticing suspicious changes based on sources dated before 2005. A clear example is in Arvanitika: v14 claims (correctly - I wish I knew how many speakers there were left) a range between 50,000 (Newmark) to 140,000 possible speakers (1977 Trudgill and Tzavaras). v15 comes up with 150,000 (2000) without a clear attribution (what happened in 2000) or an explanation of how a language in clear decline increased in numbers. Moreover v15 creates a new category of 10k speakers of Tosk Albanian for the region of Epirus; this is now separate from Arvanitika despite the fact that the page on Arvanitika still includes the reference to a Northwestern Arvanitika dialect from v14 that could only have referred to the region of Epirus. There is a clear inference (from the text as well) that the inclusion of this new category is related to the political issue of the Cham expulsion (and the claims about """"Orthodox Chams""""). Finally the very concept of what these numbers mean is in doubt. The north of the village of Andros is mentioned for Arvanitika: bilingualism in our families ended with our grandparent's generation. Extremely few among our parent's generation could converse in Arvanitika - the rest retained a few words or curses and our generation still has those (if at all). To portray the area as Arvanitika speaking is so misleading that it can only be done on purpose.

There are published books (in Greece - by leftist Greek journalists and amateur historians) that refer to figures around 200k (or even more for that matter) for Slavomacedonian speakers in Greece (again based on some dubious definition); large agenda-driven figures can also be found for Vlachs and Arvanites - since FPS, Taivo and Jim62sch and the rest of the gang are such experts on Greece I leave it as an exercise to them to locate these sources and at least put a fig leaf on. Until then use of non-existent census figure in Ethnologue makes a mockery of the academic standards they so passionately purport to be trying to uphold."""

 Demonising Turks 

It is obvious from certain Wikipedia articles that many people are using it as a vehicle to demonise Turks. Wherever possible articles derogatory to these people are being written, media and writings manipulated so that when a search is done of Google - only one version - a completely Christo-Armenia, Greek Othodox version can be found. It is seems that as in America, Armenian and Greek lobbying is alive and well here, too. What a shame that Jews, who found solace in the Turkish Ottoman Empire, while the rest of Europe was have progrom festivals have come on board, too. It seems that all that it needs to get the Jew and the gentile on the same wagon, is to beat the tired old donkey issue of the barbarious Turk.

It wears thin.

To be honest, I don't want Turkey to join the EU. I want you and teh editors and admin that are like-minded to carry on with your actions. We need to perpetuate the misnomers and misrepresentation of the Turks. Forget the Royal Academy's exhibition last year about these people. We need to keep isolating them.

Hello Attilios! First, thanks for your appreciative comments! I certainly plan to complete and bring the rest of the Isaurian period article to the same level, and then probably do the Amorian period too, for they are perhaps the most under-appreciated periods in the Empire's history. The other periods also need lots of work of course, but it will be some time before I will be able to do anything about that. I've got a couple of dozen ongoing projects or other articles I want to do, so time is short. Any help you can offer will, of course, be appreciated, be it pointing out an unclear sentence or a mistake, or adding some important point you feel I overlooked. Just be bold and edit. Since Byzantium is an area where only a handful of editors are active, IMO, if you can go ahead and write up even a sketchy, rudimentary outline on some of these topics (e.g. the horribly short Byzantium under the Justinian dynasty), you'd be helping a great deal. And if you can bring some respectable Italian sources in, that'd be a further bonus.

For the map, it has some problems, and I have been revising it for some time now, although the present status is still nowhere near good enough for it to be uploaded. For Naples and Gaeta, both cities are usually listed as acknowledging at least nominal Byzantine suzerainty at the time, their rulers accepting Byzantine titles etc. Now I admit that Byzantine Italy is not my field of expertise, so if you have some good sources to show otherwise, I'll change that too.

 Appeal 

I think your treatment of me has been a little unfair. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.
My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).
I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.
Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.
I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.
I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.
I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.
I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.
I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a rea"

 Biography 
Tizoc is a notable American Composer of New Musichttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_20th_century_classical_composers#1970s.  At a very early age he began studying piano, and in Middle School began taking trumpet lessons at the Los Angeles Music and Arts School. There he also began taking Mariachi lessons and by age 16 was fully immersed into the Mariachi world.  Today Tizoc is privileged to have had the opportunity to play along side of some of the most talented Mariachi musicians in the world and enjoys sharing his passion for Mariachi music through teaching and performing.

While completing his undergraduate work at Chapman University, through the support of professors and his wife, Tizoc realized a passion for writing music. Tizoc’s new found excitement for composition and new music led him to participate in Chapman’s New Music and Percussion Ensembles where he began learning percussion, and expanding his exposure to 21st century music. By his second year at Chapman, Tizoc gained admission into the composition program and began studying with composers Sean Heim and Shaun Naidoo. Compositionally, Tizoc is influenced by many different kinds of music, and aspires to use music as a medium to express some of our inner most emotions and states of mind.  His music has been performances by Chapman Universities Chamber Orchestra, New Music Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble as well as The California Ear Unit.

Program notes:
This piece was provoked by Mahmoud Ahmadunejad's absurd denial of the more then six million Jewish people murdered during the second world war.  Upon hearing his ridiculous denials I felt compelled to learn more about genocides around the world.  This research opened my eyes to the horror of well over 100 million innocent people exterminated due to hate and ignorance in genocides that took place throughout the modern world in the last hundred years.  The people murdered by the Nazi's in Europe during the second world war is not about numbers nor imagination, but sadly a fraction of the other genocides that took place worldwide in the 20th century, such as those in China, Japan, USSR, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Rwanda, Iraq, Aghanistan, Uganda, Bangladesh, Luberia, Sierra Leone, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, Guatemala, Chad, Taiwan, Haiti, Spain, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Chile, and Argentina to name a few.

Russell was active in the Fabian socialist movement.  His political thought was certainly very sympathetic to many technocratic ideas, but was generally more abstract than any ideology.  Roads to Freedom makes patent his political promiscuity: Russell was willing to support any movement that would tend to push history towards human freedom, humane social relations, and the rational satisfaction of human needs.  (Although when nuclear war was concerned, he seemed to prefer social injustice to complete ruin).  On the other hand, Russell was deeply skeptical of technology and science in its influence on human society and culture.  The Scientific Outlook was his vision of a scientific dystopia—one which incorporates much of technocracy.  (For the uninitiated: it is somewhat similar to Brave New World).  Although the technocratic elements are not necessarily portrayed in a negative light, they are not left blameless for the resulting society.  All in all, it seems hard to imagine that book could be the work of an enthusiastic technocrat. — 06:39, 27 January 2007"

asssiveego has posted his RfA and I have blocked him for it

Hello. I have blocked Masssiveego for his antics on Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Masssiveego which seems like a clear attempt to draw fire from people bitter with his own antics on RfA, with a minimalist nomination and tongue-in-cheek answers to the questions. He seems to have induced a bite from Pschemp at least. This lasts for a week. I previously did this for Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/The Mad Bomber for trolling his own RfA. Please review and feel free to protest on my talk page. Blnguyen | BLabberiNg 

Sounds about right. Cyde Weys 

    Good call  Samir धर्म 

        I don't see any issues with this block. Pure WP:POINT. Can we close the RfA? (Or does it need to be a 'crat?) alphaChimp laudare 

I was thinking of blocking him myself, so obviously I endorse the block. It's rather obvious that he's trolling for attention with all this RfA stuff... let's just not feed him and move on. W.marsh 

RFA has been closed. Support block. – Chacor 

                Hey should I close it then? It's already WP:SNOWballing with opposes and he is blocked after all. - Glen  - shit - 4 edit conflicts later its been done S

                    Sheesh, if you use the shortcut at least shorten the verb to WP:SNOWing. I want snow! P – Chacor 

                        I added an extra day to the block for [33] and [34]. CanadianCaesar Et tu, Brute? 

[edit]

Exhausting community patience?

Once again, it's time to bring this up. He's coming close to exhausting the community's patience, in my view. Thoughts? – Chacor 

    Not yet. I would not have blocked him at all for starting the RfA. In fact i think SNOWing this RfA was a bad idea. Rather I would have let it run the full 7 days. Having 100+ opposes might have finally gotten through to this editor that he needs to reconsider his approach. But with the RfA snowed, he's got ammo to say we aren't treating him right, etc. ++Lar: t/c 

        Perhaps, but there just isn't a reason to let trolls stay. – Chacor 

            Is this user a flat out troll? Sure, close the book right away... Or, is he rescuable? if rescuable is it worth the effort? that's how I evaluate the question of whether community patience is exhausted. I don't think ME is a flat out troll. His contributions are light so not a LOT of effort is justified but I'm not convinced he is not rescuable. Contrast with Tobias, next thread. CLEARLY not a troll, has a big contribution record, therefore worth a fair bit of effort, but I'm starting to think... not rescuable. Make sense? ++Lar: t/c 

Would we simply be gratifying him by letting the RfA run? Blnguyen | BLabberiNg 

    Hard to say. I'm not too sussed either way but I did want to throw out that on balance, gratified or not, this is one time that SNOW isn't the right thing to do. In my view anyway. ++Lar: t/c 

        I think closing it was the right thing to do to avoid disruption. Blocking him... I don't know whether he's a good faith user or not, and I suspect probably not, but I'm generally upset by the level of blocking going on in Wikipedia at the moment. The Land 

    * I think the Masssiveego's RFA voting is a problem and unhelpful, but I think imposing blocks for it is a rather drastic measure. A much better """"penalty"""" would be for the RFA closing bureaucrats to systematically disregard his votes. Regarding the RFA, I agree with Lar that I would not have blocked him for that either, and that a hundred """"oppose""""s on what is in effect an editor peer review might convey the message far more clearly than a block ever will.

    * Users are allowed to use whatever criteria they like in RfAs. His are high and somewhat arbitrary, but that's his perogative. He feels that there are problems with some admins and thus that the process should be more strict/changed. He has a right to that opinion and should not be persecuted for it. Obviously his RFA self-nom wasn't meant to be a serious attempt, but I also don't see where it caused any significant disruption justifying a block. CBD

 European Court of Human Rights's Decision is NOT a DEFAMATORY content 
You warned me to add """"defamatory content"""" in Talk:Armenian Genocide page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Armenian_Genocide). Notice that what I added is the DECISION OF EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS about Armenian """"Genocide"""". You CANNOT LABEL the decision of ECtHR as """"Defamatory Content"""". I will complain about you in related Wikipedia forums.
Notice and think twice whether the following content is defamatory:
 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

 removing aircrash investigation additions and calling them spam en third class publications 

Someone (AndyTheGrump)is accusing me of putting information about aircraft investigations as third class spam mail on wikipedia. This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am a aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol International Airport Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1973) and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so """"blessed"""" as Americans.

Somebody just puts someone has a son named David and voila, this David formed the Davidson's, but another brother formed the Cummings?? This makes no sense at all. If you did reach out to Clan Davidson, that was a wise thing to do. Who they say they descend from carries much more weight than others who might have an interest in slandering their name. It sounds like there might be a jealous Macintosh or Macpherson or someone in recent history who decided to corrupt the origins.

75603,"CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY 

Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar Month

The Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month.
This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.

Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar Month

Beginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India.
The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.

Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar Month

Since the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.

Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th Month

This Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.

Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar Month

There are users on that list that aren't even active like Isis. She was the first administrator to be banned. She doesn't even use sockpuppets. Clearly, her legal threats were attention-seeking behavior. Jessica isn't. Apparently Wikipedians like to keep track of her and not Isis. So it would make sense to add her to the list. That way everyone can keep track of her and nobody can say that they don't know. Administrators can block accounts on sight. So if anyone acts like her, they will all be blocked. Including her on the list is vital because some people don't know her specific behaviors and if they have that similar behavior, they will be blocked on sight. Jessica never asked for attention. The Wikipedians gave it to her. So maybe you should ask them why they gave attention to her. Apparently Wikipedia is also mad at her to create an article for her on ED.

1. Liberation theology is a phenomenon with an extraordinary number of layers. There is a whole spectrum from radically marxist positions, on the one hand, to the efforts which are being made within the framework of a correct and ecclesial theology, on the other hand, a theology which stresses the responsibility which Christians necessarily hear for the poor and oppressed, such as we see in the documents of the Latin American Bishops' Conference (CELAM) from Medellin to Puebla. In what follows, the concept of liberation theology will be understood in a narrower sense: it will refer only to those theologies which, in one way or another, have embraced the marxist fundamental option. Here too there are many individual differences, which cannot be dealt with in a general discussion of this kind. All I can do is attempt to illuminate certain trends which, notwithstanding the different nuances they exhibit, are widespread and exert a certain influence even where liberation theology in this more restricted sense does not exist.

As can be seen he is being quite clear in that only one strand of liberation theology is being condemned.  """

If a professor is significant in his or her community, they'll sooner or later get a chair at their, presumably well known, university and that, for us, is a sufficient condition for inclusion.

It is a big responsibility that Wikipedia has, and that responsibility should be free of cultural bias, even if it may seem to go against what we have been led to believe by American media and culture.

When I first started looking into this topic, the articles I found were woefully inaccurate and defiantly biased.  I still feel that objectively, the definition should clearly state that most cross-breeds lead to a reduction in fitness.  Heterosis can be induced through breeding stragity such as line-breeding but it is a wasteful effort.  Random mixing of genes is similar to random mutation, most of which is deadly and not beneficial to the gene pool.  99% of mutations are deleterious.

Respect of natural selection should be the default position.  There are quantifiable difference between the races which were developed over hundreds of generations and whatever diversity we have managed to achieve should be cherished, what makes us different is what makes us special.  By mixing the races, in one or two generations we can undo the work of hundreds or thousands of years of evolution."

 Midway = turning point 

In my view, if there WAS a turning point in the war on Japan, Midway has to be it. While the Japanese had been stopped at Coral Sea, they still had the initiative; they could still choose where and when to attack, and the allies had to react. But not after Midway! It was, after all, THEY that launched the Midway/Aleutians operation, and THEY that were then rocked back on their heels, and THEY that fled afterward. It was THEY that had lost 2/3 of their big, fast carriers (and the carrier was to the War in the Pacific what the ballistic missile was to the Cold War. Somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the Japanese fleet was still a formidable force, but that is nonsense; all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier-equipped US NAvy)). Far from being """"merely"""" a tactical victory, it changed the whole complexion of the war. 

Now, while they DID attempt some more offensive action (notably by trying to take Port Moresby, again, this time over land via the Kokoda Trail in the 2nd half of 1942), this was all relatively minor, designed to strengthen their DEFENSIVE positions not to conquer, and was  ultimately almost all unsuccessful. They never again tried the kind of massive, seaborne, combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the Pacific in a just a few months. Then just 2 months after Midway the US landed on Guadalcanal, and clearly the initiative was ours, and Japan was in defensive mode. Thus the Guadalcanal campaign can't be considered the actual turning point either - by then the US was clearly on the attack.

I don't think the argument that there is no turning point because Japan could never have ultimately 'won' the Pacific war works out either. Japanese planners DID know that they could not win a long war MILITARILY but that was not their plan. Strategically their plans went something like: 

1. Start the war from as superior a position as possible (hence Pearl Harbor)
2. Race across the Pacific, seizing resources and territory BEFORE the US could gear up for war.
3. Attain as defensible a position as possible (Hence the Kokoda Trail offensive and takeover of the Solomons) and DIG IN.
4. Let the US grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses. 
5.Win a favorable peace settlement when the US tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses.

But they failed at (1) when they didn't sink the US carriers at Pearl Harbor, and only 6 months later Midway signalled the early end of (2). By the failure to take Port Moresby, they also failed at part of (3). They had some hope to succeed at (5); when the bloody costs of both Tarawa and Buna-Gona became known, US public opinion was shaken. Even as late as 1945, many americans found the though of the casualties invading Japan would cost to be appalling.

So, MY conclusion is that Midway WAS *the* turning point in the Pacific. I realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective, but I really think if there was one in the South Pacific, it has to be Midway.

Dear Ploversegg,

We are a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and AU Sharjah, researching the experiences of editors of content about the Arab world on Wikipedia. We are interested in your experiences of editing Wikipedia and are organising two events that we think you would be an excellent contributor to.

First, starting next week on Monday 27th August, we are hosting an online discussion about what it is like to contribute to Wikipedia in Arabic and to articles about the Middle East and North Africa. We are interested in what barriers you perceive to exist in Wikipedia, how articles can be made better and generally what can be done to expand and improve Arabic Wikipedia. This discussion will take place on a MediaWiki hosted at our institution and be available in English and Arabic. We will allow users to create their own discussion pages in addition to our discussions.

Second, we are hosting face-to-face workshops in Cairo from 21st-22nd October 2012. If you are interested in this we may be able to pay your travel and accommodation costs depending on where you live. This workshop will cover similar themes to the online discussion but will allow participants to meet one another and benefit from being together.  

We will take care of the organization and planning and all you have to do is show up and be ready to discuss. But if you would like to help shape some of the discussion themes in advance, please let us know. We have booked time in the workshops for Wikipedian-led discussions.  

More details can be found in our “Frequently Asked Questions” section below. 

We would be delighted to welcome you to either (or both) event. Please let me know (wikiproject@oii.ox.ac.uk) if you would like to participate and we can send you more details.

Sincerely,

Frequently Asked Questions:
 
What is the purpose of this project?

This project is about who represents the Arab World on Wikipedia, and how the Middle East and the Arab world is represented on Wikipedia. We are studying Wikipedia through statistics, edit  history data and personal experiences. Our ultimate goal is to help Wikipedia grow in size and fairness and do academic research on this topic. You can read more about the project here: http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=70 From this page, you can also find a biography of the researchers. You may also want to see our interactive visualizations about Wikipedia here: http://wikiproject.oii.ox.ac.uk/ 

Who is funding this project?

This project is funded by the International Development Research Centre (http://www.idrc.ca). This organization is funded by the Canadian government to improve infrastructure across the world, including online content. We have been working with the IDRC since June 2010. 

Why did you contact me?

Because you’re awesome. In all seriousness, we have been looking through Wikipedia for active editors based on user activity in either Arabic Wikipedia or articles about the Arab world. We have not contacted everyone we could, but we contact people that we think will help to balance the discussion and help us (and each other) learn more about the state of Wikipedia.  

Do I need to participate in both events?

Not at all. You are welcome to participate in both or just one. We recognise that it will be more convenient for some people to have online conversations and for others to speak in person. For some people it will not be practical to fly to the Middle East, but we still consider their contributions important and want to give them a voice in this work.

Can I use my Wikipedia handle in the online discussion?

You do not need to use any particular name on the online forum. All we need is a valid email address so you can register. You can post using your real name, your Wikipedia name or a completely different nickname, whatever allows you to speak your mind most effectively. 

What sort of travel funding will you supply for the face-to-face workshop?

We have funding for travel and accommodation costs for approximately twenty participants depending on where they are coming from. If you would like to join us in one of the face-to-face meetings then we wi"

155225,"Osteosarcoma Risk 
I have edited the statement regarding the association between neutering and osteosarcoma (OSA) because it was far stronger than the citation, or the literature in general, supports. In a single study of a single breed with a known risk for osteosarcoma far higher than most other breeds, the data showed the total lifetime exposure to sex hormones was negatively correlated with the incidence of OSA. The incidence of the disease was not statistically different between neutered and intact animals overall, though it was different between animals neutered at less than 1 year of age and intact animals. And there is no reason to suggest these findings would support a general relationship between neutering and OSA incidence in other breeds or mixed-breed dogs. Given the questionable clinical significance of the finding (intact animals actually died slightly, though not significantly, earlier than neutered animals overall) and the much more thoroughly demonstrated protective benefits of neutering on life expectancy and other kinds of cancer, I do not find this study sufficient to support a general assertion that OSA risk is a meaningful disadvantage of neutering.

 Some things to note about Stalin 

1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.

2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.

3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by """"kind ol' Uncle Joe"""" babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a """"dictator"""" per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.

4., Did Stalin murder his wife? Has this issue been settled conclusively?

5., Hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead Stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in Budapest during the 1956 revolution:

(deindent) Not even wrong only if you don't understand what he's doing. These are all standard problems for the many millions of people who have tried to make sense of infinite arithmetic at some point in their lives.

The number  ...9997 in Archimedes' system is also known as the number -3, which almost is the """"largest prime"""" in Ludwig's order on the Plutonian integers. You would think ...99998 might be the right one, but that's -2, and it is clearly divisible by two. So maybe ...9997 should be thought of as divisible by three, but dividing by three is different than dividing by two in base-10, because two divides 10 and three does not. So maybe that's a self-consistent definition in a 10-based infinite arithmetic with the order he chooses. Maybe not. I don't know, but neither do you, and to pretend otherwise is insincere. It's not incoherent, just original, and incomplete. The methodology is obviously many, many, painstaking infinite digit calculations, with the extra burden that the rules keep shifting whenever he finds an inconsistency. 

The reason he claims transcendental numbers are incomplete is because, if you accept that the integers are Plutonian, the real numbers are only """"finitely"""" wide. Normally, a real number can be thought of as a map from Z->digits, giving it's digit sequence. Unfortunately, Plutonium's """"Z"""" is just as large as the real numbers, so that a real number is really only a sequence of digits, because a sequence in this view cannot be viewed as a map from Z-> digits. In this view Z is larger than any sequence (the integers are """"uncountable""""). So the real numbers have """"gaps"""" which would be filled by reciprocals of infinite integers. But large integers don't have reciprocals in Plutonium's system, because he can't make any sense out of bi-infinite sequences:

Numbers like ... 999123.3333..... are not allowed because you can't do multiplication digit by digit.

So he doesn't think of the real numbers as containing the integers, he has two classes of numbers the """"Adic integers"""" which are infinite to the left and finite to the right, and the """"real numbers"""" which are infinite to the right and finite to the left, and it is illegal to add an adic integer and a real number.

The reason Archimedes Plutonium keeps working on the Riemann Hypothesis is because he feels he can say something new about the distribution of primes because he has knowledge of some infinite ones. This is because he can ask questions like """"if I choose an infinite integer at random, digit by digit, do I get a prime number?"""" Those sorts of questions have analytic counterparts about real numbers (complete numbers really). He probably feels the twin-prime conjecture is false, becuase, what's the chance that the infinite integer ....321113 and ....321115 are both prime? He also probably feels that an infinite even number can never be the sum of two primes. These last two statements are both based on my own thinking. He might thinks that there are very many primes at infinity, I don't know for sure.

Look, I am not saying his mathematical musing are not cranckish. But recognize that Archimedes Plutonium is to cranck science as Isaac Newton is to mainstream science. He has seen futher than others even though he stands on the shoulders of no-one. """

Yeah, it's pretty fascinating. I disagree that New Englanders moved into New York City and changed the accent to non-rhotic.

I think New Englanders might be around # 178 on the list of groups moving to NYC, and the New Engand -ar is so different from the NYC -ar that we can forget the whole theory. Also the Northern Cities accent shift is food for a nice academic paper (that's what scholars do, right?) but incorrectly implies that northern cities like Syracuse or Albany did something or other to change the accent from the rural acreas, when the truth is that the rural accent around Syracuse is the same as that in the city. People move back and forth all the time. You have to have a big city like NYC or Boston to have enough isolation to create a new accent. There is no variation in accent anywhere from eastern NY to Syracuse, city, rural, or whatever, because people move around too much and there is no isolation.

In Delhi, diplomatic sources in the Chinese embassy said, 

As a side note, India needs to take more consideration of external threats. And it seems naive to think that India can continue to develop as a global economic power without also bringing its defence capabilities up to the standards of other nations in the region. From our POV it seems poverty should be their priority, but the UK, US etc all have poverty and still spend billions on effective defence measures.

Hi again dear

yes I strongly support independence of """"south Azerbaijan"""" from Iran, If Green movement could change somethings, probably I would change my idea, but I dont want to be under Islamic rejim anymore and I support the changing of destiny of Azerbaijani people.

And about """"Azerbaijanis are Turks or not"""". Despite you are talking about Persian theory of the roots of Turkish people, we all know that Turks started to migrate here circa 1000 ad when Saljuk Turks of west branch(Oghuz)started to come, but infact it is not important when they came here. The important thing is """"EVERY ONE"""" in Azerbaijan feel themselves as Azerbaijani( and not Azeri which is an invented word by Persians) Turks and believe that they r Turks and speak Turkish lang. as same as Turks of Turkey. You can come here and ask yourself one by one, you will see. It is so irrarational to say to some one that:"""" No, you r not Turk, you dont know who you are! I know! you r Azeri and Azeris are indoeuropean."""" Pls dont tell us who we r! let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a Turk whatever others like or not. 

About Aran, as I know we didnt have """"Eyalat Aran"""" in the Qajar era. We had """"Eyalat Azarbaijan"""" and both Azerbaijan rep. and Armenia was part of this big Eyalat as well as south Azerbaijan. Aran was part of this big land. But the important thing is, the name of land is not important here as well, the important thing is the people who live in Azerbaijan rep.( former Aran as you called) are of my race and we r same nation. You may call there Azerbaijan or Aran but the important thing is: """"here a nation live which called themselves Azerbaijani Turks!"""". You may call them whatever you want as well as their land, the important thing is what they call themselves. If they change the name of their republic, will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves """"Arani"""" and start to speak """"Aranian"""" language! which does not exist! 

Ok let's think Azerbaijanis r not Turk, so what they r? Azeri? Ok, let's call them Azeri, what is the next step? You will ask them to forget to speak in Turkish language and start to speak Persian? Or not, speak Azeri lang.? So what is Azeri lang.? where is it? Can you learn it to about 32 million people? let's thing pragmatic as well as rational. Even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically, you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of 1000 years ago nor Persian.

Also I dont rely neither to researches of Kasravi nor Zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. One was Paniranist other was Panturkist. Some of their researches looks really funny!

About the names of Turkish places and cities, I guess you have never ever travell to Azerbaijan. If you were here, you'll see that Iranian government has changed the names during Pahlavi era! Some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example Tabriz has a suburb in Western part of the city called """"Akhmagaya"""" which in Turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place, do u know what is its official name? """"Ahmagiyyeh!"""" the lands of stupid people! All of the Turkish names tried to change to a Persian words which looks verbally simmilar them! The fact is Persian never have been to Azerbaijan. Most of the Azerbaijani names have Armenian or Tat roots not Persian. My believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like Tats, Armenians, and other caucasian tribes lived here and then Turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called Azerbaijani Turks nowadays. They have their own culture, music, dance, cuisine etc. which seperate them form Persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of Turks of Anatolia which believes that they r 100 percent Turk! I told you history is not important than today, the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a Turk. I dont know what they want us to feel in Tehran!

The name of Azar abade gan looks wrong as well. This word cant change to Azarbaijan during history. I guess the word was """"Azar pay gan"""" (maybe) which zoroastrian Persians called, not Azar abad gan which Ferdowsi mentioned in Shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now!

I had a look to your files about vote frauding which I still believe is correct as well. The diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of Iran will give their votes to Ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election, but you know there is unwrittenable rules in Iran which every one know. Whenever some one come and ask me in person that """"do u like Islamic republic, Ali khameni and bla bla bla"""" I will answer """"YES""""! cos I dont want to lose my life! We dont have life guaranty"

Pic
What does everyone think about moving the photo of him as Bond to the top? It's current, and it's a much better picture. Sure, the top one is more real, but it's a little too real. Like, just rolled out of bed, poured some beer on his cheerios and walked out to get the paper kind of real. When I brought this page up, I said, """"Yikes! That guy is uglier than Roger Moore!"""" The Bond pic does him justice, though.  
I'd rather leave it as is. Alternatively you could find a better image to replace the """"roll out of bed"""" picture.  
No problem, just figured I'd run it past you. I'm sure if there were any public domain photos of him out there that are more flattering, a better Bond fan than me would have found one by now. Happy editing!

It's correct, but I wouldn't say Lazenby had an era at all.  
I would say Sean Connery era because he returned in Diamonds are Forever in 1971 after Lazenby in OHMSS. Lazenby did not have an era. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) .

Introduction to US audiences
I don't know if it's correct to say that the Lara Croft film introduced him to American audiences. I remember hearing some buzz about him in Elizabeth which while it didn't do Lara Croft-level box office, was still a substantial success in North America. Thoughts?  

I hadn't heard about that, but it's no big deal to me either way. I made the change because the text as it stood made it seem that Road to Perdition was his first introduction to US audiences, which on the evidence of Tomb Raider was manifestly untrue. If there is clear evidence of Elizabeth'''s priority, I have no problem with that.  
I'm not familiar enough with Elizabeth to be certain. I do know it was listed as one of his career highlights more often than Tomb Raider when he was announced as Bond; the only time I saw Tomb Raider connected to him in the media was when it was rumored Angelina Jolie was up for the role of Vesper.  

While it's probably the better film — and was even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar — from memory his role in Elizabeth is a relatively minor one. Certainly he wasn't one of the main stars (who were pretty much Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes and Craig's Our Friends in the North'' co-star Christopher Eccleston).

Wikipedia Guidelines: The common theme in the notability guidelines is that there must be verifiable, objective evidence that the subject has received significant attention from independent sources to support a claim of notability. The absence of citations in an article (as distinct from the non-existence of sources) does not indicate that the subject is not notable.

Wikipedia Guideliens: No subject is automatically or inherently notable merely because it exists: The evidence must show the topic has gained significant independent coverage or recognition, and that this was not a mere short-term interest, nor a result of promotional activity or indiscriminate publicity, nor is the topic unsuitable for any other reason. Sources of evidence include recognized peer reviewed publications, credible and authoritative books, reputable media sources, and other reliable sources generally.

The Harbrace Guide to Writing books (both of them, published and distributed to colleges throughout the U.S. referencing the film) falls under credible and authoritative books.

Since I am a long-term donor of Wikipedia, it seems that this is a direct violation of what Wikipedia professes their site is. 'The Free Encyclopedia'. An Encyclopedia is a reference for documented, written sources. Together, all the sources add up to an article, which deems notability as referenced above.  I am not trying to be argumentative, but factual in what Wikipedia claims they are as a source, and what they have told me they are in terms of my donations as a supporter over the years. 

With the extra reference you have acknowledge above, the third reference of the Harbrace Guide to Writing (100,000 print copies) is yet another verifiable source. Again, this is not a confrontation. thank you."

As a social scientist, I was surprised to see the magnified importance of the behaviour and perception factors. I think I should learn more on social psychology and related behavioural disciplines to apply in my work.

Yes, it is implied, but I dislike implications within a definition, even when they are correct. And I believe a general reader may share the sentiment, or even get confused.

Decades ago, before computers, it was important to make simple equations even simpler. To that aim, static equilibrium was used in some accelerating system problems, of course with the inertial forces included (the approach was credited to dAlembert). A simple example would be to determine maximum acceleration of a motorbike for a given friction coefficient (no limitation on engine power). When solved in the accelerating frame in which the center of mass was at rest, one could use torques about any point (as both static equilibrium conditions apply) and achieve minor simplifications in calculation. As I recall, one would casually refer to that accelerating frame as """"the motorbike CM frame"""". Why not, the meaning was perfectly clear, and what authority might there be to forbid such usage?

That being said, I am aware of the fact that relativistic particle collisions are best described in inertial COM frames. Some authors call them """"COM systems"""", as e.g. in the Sears and Zeemansky College Physics. (They even claim that """"COM system"""" is a relativistic generalization of """"CM system"""" - people will use various conventions.)  """

 TruSilver, Mediation, et al 

You can include the following statement as part of the mediation template if you wish: I'm not able to edit at the moment because jdchamp's admin shopping on WP:AIV finally paid off

While, obviously, I'm happy to accept any attempt to produce a better US Mobile Phone Companies template, I have concerns about the mediation proposal currently made on the subject.

My first concern is that mediation is supposed to be one of the tools used after discussion has failed on the relevant article's discussion page. At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)

Mediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that's based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion. While that different of opinion might exist at this point, unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully (as in, gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments), there has been no discussion, and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature.

My second concern, and believe me I'm not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I'm absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he's done is right: but that said, I don't trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp. TruSilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp's on-going campaign. In particular:

 TruSilver has accused me of using his talk: page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp. This is untrue: I have only ever posted once to TruSilver's talk: page, posting an apology for the fact he'd been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it. After it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time, and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind, I made the decision to not post there again.

 TruSilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp's differences with me, these differences concerning the Mobile Phone Companies template. This is also manifestly untrue. I have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page's Talk: page, even participating in a poll that I believe was posted prematurely, arguing why I believe what I do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties. I have removed jdchamp's vandalism of my page, which in some cases involved posting claims that he was """"willing to discuss"""" various issues, but were neither posted in the correct place, nor actual discussions of those issues.

 TruSilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me, accusing me of being dysfunctional, and of disruptiveness, edit warring, and incivility. With the possible exception of my (pretty justified) expression of frustration last night, nothing I've done of late fits the latter category, and the nearest thing I've done that comes to """"edit warring"""" consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp. The other comments are just plain insulting and wrong.

I've suffered a sustained campaign of harassment against me for most of the last 15 days. I asked for help, and instead the admin who put his hand up has essentially acted as an enabler for the person harassing me. Other than an ultimately unenforced threat to block jdchamp if he continued to spam WP:AIV with inappropriate demands I be blocked, nothing has been done to encourage jdchamp to tone down his behavior, and as he showed last night with three warnings, and multiple reverts on my Talk: page, his behavior remains as bad as ever.

While I'm sure TruSilver has acted in what he believes is the most appropriate way given the facts immediately available to him, I don't believe he h"

If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL.

My name is Mrs. Rebecca Song, a Portuguese national .I have been diagnosed with Esophageal  cancer which has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. 

As you read this, you do not have to feel sorry for me as it is a universal truth that we all must die someday. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that
was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just accumulating all the wealth in the world as I lay helplessly on my sick bed.

If I was given a second chance to live again, I'm sure I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it owing to what has befallen me now. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Seventy Five Million United States Dollars ($75, 000, 000.00) that I have with a Finance Vaulting Unit in Europe.

All I am asking of you is to assist me in making the collection of this deposit and dispatching the funds to any
charity of your choice.

N/B: Kindly note that 30% of this funds must go to the tsunami victims, 50% to other Charity Organization and 20% for your effort and time. I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation,as I am using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you.

Please contact me as soon as you get this email if you are capable and sincere to handle this transaction on my behalf so that I can forward to you all relevant documents necessary for the claims and the name of the security firm where the funds are deposited and a picture of my present condition.

I think that this might be an oversimplification of the matter, as it depends largely on both the type of rigging being used and the direction (relevant to the wind direction) that one wishs to go.

For instance, many of the large square rigged ships did move essentially through the force of the wind pushing on the sail. I suppose technically the wind is piling up behind the sail (thus high pressure area) and the difference in pressure between the higher and lower pressure areas on opposite sides of the sail causes it to move, which is the same principle as that which generates lift. However, unlike in the case of aerofoils (aka wings) there is *not* a higher wind speed going across the back of the sail than the front.

In short, while the pressure differential as cause of movement remains valid, the cause of these pressure differences is not the same as for wings.

Lift (force)

Anyway, hope this helps.

I did not ignore your response; I thought my answer was clear  but I'll ride the donkey for ya. 
 A single section containing criticisms is an example of a poorly structured article as it means that people reading about a subject have to look in the section about it for the 'non-criticism' and then a second section to see if there is any criticism. This is a statement to which I have refuted wholly by showing you an example of an article that is not porrly (rather, superbly) written; also, the criticism section does nothing but DESCRIBE the criticism involved with the topic (eg. why/how/what re criticism of the Canadian Charter...) See?
Naming a section 'Criticisms' or something similar is giving Wikipedia a POV. Specious. We wish to DESCRIBE the criticisms, not create them. We therefore need a section do do so. (I concur, though; forking is counter-productive. Man you got a little pet name for everything.)
*...such a section is normally just a troll magnet and POV magnet, making things difficult to manage. First, that is tantamount to cutting off your nose to spite your face: crappy articles because a good one would attract undue attention? That's silliness. Moreover, good articles are far less likely to be attacked by vandals. And lastly, protect the pages once well-written - don't make drivel out of the article just because writing it correctly (i.e., like the featured articles) would attract attention. Change the management method instead.

On top of all that, I submit that this PETA/AR debacle is so controversial for no other reason than that the articles are poorly written. They are biased, they are agenda-driven, they lack recognition (DESCRIPTION) of criticisms and they are quite obviously over-protected and coddled over by people who truly don't want criticism to see the light of day. 

Now, please list all the controversial items re PETA for me please."

Further, in light of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2001 in Alexander v. Sandoval, and noting that the text and structure of Title X do not create a private right of action to enforce Title X, the executive branch shall construe Title X not to create a private right of action.

The addition does meet your requirements.  The bass player from The Steadys (Ani Schempfe a.k.a. DJ On-E) joined the pop group Dee-Lite in 1993 after The Steadys broke up.  This fits with you requirements if I'm not mistaken.  The Steadys are also on a live album called NYC SKA LIVE which was released in 1990, so there is physical proof (Recorded media) and this I believe also fits your requirements.  Thank you!

2. Shoplifter has been here forever with no complaints. The one I saw recently was """"Surely not Shoplifter"""" so they removed it based on opinion. And as for the other we had an agreement a while back to keep this one but people have started removing it again. This was a collaboration from Green Day and Husker Du.

 my editor review 

Hi István,

Thanks so much for your thoughtful input to my editor review! Firstly, to answer the question you asked: I'm not sure yet if I really want to be an admin. Like I said, I've been toying with the idea, but I keep having these nagging doubts that it wouldn't be right for meI'd get carried away with my newfound powers, or I'd feel pressured by the responsibility that goes along with those powers, or I wouldn't have the time to be an effective admin anyway, or I'd spend so much of my wikitime admin-ing that I'd lose sight of actually writing and editing. So as I think of it now, mulling it over, I suppose I'm leaning against it. There is a certain """"prestige"""" awarded those who are elected admins and that certainly had an attraction for methe satisfaction of earning the respect from my fellow editors, being entrusted with the special toolsbut that's no reason to seek adminship. Yeah...you and the nagging little voice in my head are probably right, adminship isn't my thing.

Regarding your criticisms: I know I'm naive, not to mention emotional to a fault. (as you know all too well!) There are a lot of things that should just slide right off my back but for whatever quirk in my personality, they don't. I've always been like this and probably always will beheightened emotional sensitivity is hardly a detriment to me as a musician/artist, but it definitely can get in the way sometimes in places like this. I'm learning to deal with it better, I think, just by getting more experience, but it's probably always going to be an issue for me to some extent. And to be completely fair to myself, I'm actually quite stable at the """"core of my being"""" (to use a cheesy phrase) and there's very little in everyday life that can really hurt me deeply. (i.e. stuff waaaay more serious than dumb arguments on the wiki.) I haven't totally lost perspective! ;-) 

Your comments about my tendency to try desperately to find common ground with unreasonable editors were also spot-on; I certainly have done that but didn't quite consciously realize it until you pointed it out!! I hate the types who always go around making enemies and assuming the worst, and I always try to avoid being like that, the obvious result being that I often overcompensate and end up gullible and easily pushed-around: """"I'll say whatever you like, just please don't start a fight!!"""" (I've done that most often with a certain Serbian fellow, for some reasonhoping to score brownie points and maybe win civil treatment eventually?!) Lousy foreign-policy strategy really...I'll try to do a better job of standing my ground in the future.   

I must say though, I'm quite touched by the compliments section of your review: I guess my charming and atmosphere-improving qualities could be considered the good side of my diplomatic naivete? ;-) I'm glad to hear that my efforts are appreciatedespecially glad to hear it from you, since you are without a doubt another of those people who makes the Wiki not suck, and I value your opinion quite highly.

113026,"Attempt of translation of (French) Magneto-Explosive Generator page 

Talk:Explosively Pumped Flux Compression Generators/Translation from french page

Explosively pumped flux compression generators generate high power electrical pulses by compressing magnetic flux using explosives.

The first work on these generators was conducted by the VNIIEF centre for nuclear research in Sarov at the beginning of the 1950's, and then, independently, by LANL in the USA.

 History 

At the start of the 1950's, the need for very short and powerful electrical pulses became evident to Soviet scientists  conducting nuclear fusion research. At that point in time, the Marx generator, which stores energy in capacitors, was the only device capable of producing such high power pulses. The prohibitive cost of the capacitors required to obtain the desired power motivated the search for a more economical device. The first Magneto-explosive generators, which followed from the ideas of Andreï Sakharov, were designed to fill this role. 
 
 Principles of Function  

''In the following text, we will use terms like 'compression' or 'confinement' of the magnetic field. Because of the similarity between certain properties of gases and magnetic fields, the conventional use of these terms can be extended by analogy to magnetic fields. Various uses of this similarity can be found in this article by J.-P. Petit..

Magneto-explosive generator use a technique called 'magentic flux compression', which will be described in detail later. The technique is made possible when the timescales over which the device operates are sufficiently brief that resistive current loss 
is negligible, and the magnetic flux on any surface surrounded by a conductor (copper wire, for example) remains constant, even though the size and shape of the surface may change. 

This flux conservation can be demonstrated from Maxwell's equations. The most intuitive explanation of this conservation of enclosed flux follows from the principle that any change in an electromagnetic system provokes an effect in order to oppose the change. For this reason, reducing the area of the surface enclosed by a conductor, which would reduce the magnetic flux, results in the induction of current in the electrical conductor, which tends to return the enclosed flux to its original value. In magneto-explosive generators, this phenomenon is obtained by various techniques which depend on powerful explosives.  Other techniques exist which do not depend on  explosives. Notably, see  : Flux compression scheme used at the Gramat centre of study, in doctoral thesis, Mathias Bavay, 8 july 2002.

The compression process allows the chemical energy of the explosives to be (partially) transformed into electrical energy, using the magnetic flux as an intermediary agent of energy storage. (Note that I didn't like the catalyser argument: the magnetic field is highly dynamic, and in a sense consumes the reactant (the initial kinetic energy), even though the flux is conserved, unlike most chemical catalysts, which act mostly just to bring together the reactants in the correct configuration. A closer chemical analysis would be something like electron transport in photosynthesis, perhaps, but that really doesn't add anything useful to the discussion). 

 Elementary description of flux compression 

An external magnetic field (blue lines) thread a closed ring made of a perfect conductor (with zero resistivity). The nine field lines represent the magnetic flux threading the ring.

After the ring's diameter is reduced, the magnetic flux threading the ring, represented by five field lines, is reduced by the same ratio as the area of the ring. The variation of the magnetic flux induces a current in the ring (red arrows), which in turn creates a new magnetic field, so that the total flux in the interior of the ring is maintained (four green field lines added to the five blue lines give the original nine field lines). 

By adding together the external magnetic field and the induced field,"

Nemesis: Germany (February – May 1945)"""" and that events were reported in most English language histories as TR described them, and that his escape was by the middle 50's thought to be very unlikely by most people, although a favourite parlour game (which used to be included in this article) was to say """"if Hitler had survived he would be insert age"""". I added the sentence with cadaver to the article back in May 2006, one of the advantages of using the word cadaver was that as a summary of a source I used it removed any possibility that it was [[wp:plagiarism|plagiarism], and another advantage is it is accurate. However although I prefer the word cadaver in this sentence if there was a consensus to change it to corpse I would not object.

Hello Tobias,
Thought you'd like to know I've recently concluded a useful email correspondence with a member of staff at the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). In short, it appears the NGA uses a four to five level system not unlike NUTS+LAU; I've transcribed it from the table sent by email into the wikitable below:

 Feature Designation Code  Name                                  Text ADM1  first-order administrative division   a primary administrative division of a country, such as a state in the United States ADM2  second-order administrative division  a subdivision of a first-order administrative division ADM3  third-order administrative division   a subdivision of a second-order administrative division ADM4  fourth-order administrative division  a subdivision of a third-order administrative division ADMD  administrative division               an administrative division of a country, undifferentiated as to administrative level

The NGA leaves the definitions (""""Text"""" in the above table) of ADMs 2-4 """"intentionally vague... All we attempt to identify with the ADM is the hierarchical structure, and if there is no hierarchy, then the level of importance or size (with ADM1 being the largest).""""

In a table of global country subdivisions, would you expect all those entities found in a particular column (i.e. at a particular level) to be similar in """"importance or size"""" – presumably where """"size"""" might mean area or population...?

Discussing The Existence of “repulsion particle” And Its Significance              
Zhuang Yiliong
Shanghai Institute of Science and Technology Management

Abstract:This report has advanced a assume about the existence of  “repellention” by a kind of new idea. Beginning with this, I have explained more successfully some import theory questions in the area of the present physics, cosmology and philosophy ect. At same time a few of new reasons have been raised But this is only rough idea of physical philosophy. many key details need to be answered by the improving science in the future.
Key words: repulsion particle, the velocity of light, red shift, cosmos background.
  
　　　While the researched object of physics are increasingly getting its limit observed through the instrument, the function in the research of academic ideas are more important. In this article, only assumes the existence of a new particle, so it seems possible for many difficulty of physics and cosmology to be resulted. Maybe the key to unlock the door of advancing access of physics lies not in the building of physics, but in the palace of philosophy.

One、Grounds of advancing the existence of  “repulsion particle” 

Philosophic puzzles: gravity and repulsion, this is a pair of antiquated contradiction, theory of physics is a philosophic  lame. Angels said that the true theory  of matter should give the equal status to gravity and repulsion, the theory of matter only based on gravity is wrong, insufficiency and unilateral. Newton needed to find the first driving force for his physics, or else the world can’t act .
There is contradiction between Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Einstein’s mass-velocity expression. In the law universal gravitation, the magnitude of gravitation is direct proportional to mass of the matter, the bigger the mass is, the stronger the gravity is; while in the mass-velocity expression, with the speed of the matter increasing, the mass will add. If the “mass” of the two law is the same, then the speed of matter will increase, and the gravity will be stronger, the matter will be drawn too tighten to move by the gravity. But in fact, it’s just opposition, the shotted cannonball is incline to break loose the gravitation, provided that the speed is high enough, it is able to fly off the orbit of the earth, even the solar system. This shows that the mass of adding with the speed increasing is different with that works on the gravitation, because it manifest obviously a kind of repulsion confronting the gravitation.  So that, the two characteristics (speed increases, gravitation reduces; speed reduces, gravitation increases.) out while the state of moving matter changes .it is right to reflect the invert process between gravity and repulsion inside the moving matter , and indicate the existence of difference idiocratic mass.
Newton believed: falling of an apple is because of the function of gravitation, then, we can question in the opposition, how can the apple get to the top of the tree? If we block out all of the complicated growing process of all tree with black-box theory, and only consider the beginning and the ending state, then, in the opinion of physics, there must be a kind of universal repulsion fighting back the gravitation working on the apple and pushing it to the high place. Therefor, the universal repulsion should exist everywhere, as well as the universal gravitation.
What is the essence of “force”? This question has been disputing for hundreds of years, and it’s still not clear today. Newton said that it is the measurement of the acceleration of moving matter. But this only describes the force, not explains the essential mechanism. So, in Newton mechanics, the mass of  the moving matter is unchangeable. Einstein brought out the character that the mass of matter is changed with the speed. He thought the activity of matter is result from getting energy, while energy can agglomerate matter, and this character of this matter is the same as the original matter, so can be added, resulting that the mass of matter may trend to infinite with the speed increasing. If we can import a kind of repulsion to explain it, and give the energy a carrier of practicality, then, the relation of movement and the “force” will be more clear.
The radiant energy is always multiple of some elementary unit, what on earth is the physical meaning of Plank quantum constants? If it can be seen as a material particle, and indicate the existence of repulsion particle? Ray radiation has the two character of wave and particle itself. As to E=h*v, Plank regarded the radiant energy as constant h multiply frequency v from the site of wave theory; if, from the point of particle theory,  we can regard it as the h combination of v quantu"

51203,"""== Removing Dyer references ==

I propose removing from the references section the books written by Dyer. I have not read Dyer's books, but from what Node_ue says, it seems to me that he's just a crank. He appears to have no clue in linguistics.

I don't think a sane linguist would take two random people, put them to translate a text from Yiddish, compare the resulting texts and get to the conclusion: """"yep, we have two different languages"""".

Also, he uses made-up expressions such as """"sovetul (sic!) de deputaţi"""" or """"cuvinte slujitoare"""" to prove his points, which is akin to data fabrication in regular science. 

Bogdan, Dyer did not come to the conclusion that Moldovan and Romanian are truly separate languages.
With regards to the parallel translation, he says """"the greatest difference between these two texts are in the vocabularies and in the styles they employ. There is a more 'flowering' prose in the Moldovan text... to reiterate, the difference here is one of style, not one of substance"""".

 Actually, """"le style est l'homme même"""", as Buffon once said. Dyer starts from the premise that the style in each country is homogenous: it is not, there are much more differences between different individuals in the same country. His ways of studying language is just as useless as the way the Nazis studied genetics by assuming the homogenity of the Aryan race.  

 Yes, that's his point. That nearly all of the differences between the two passages are not differences between two languages, but just because two different translators.
 Earlier, you said """"...a sane linguist would take two random people, put them to translate a text from Yiddish..."""". Actually, he got these comparisons from published translations in """"Romanian"""" and """"Moldovan"""". He didn't just walk up to random people on the street.  

The only actual possible grammatical difference he finds in the texts is Moldovan """"pe tot ce vretsi"""", and Romanian """"pe cît vretsi"""". There were very few web results for """"pe tot ce vreti"""" (about 5), and one of them was from the Zdob shi Zdub website (a Moldovan band). There were no results in Moldova for """"pe cit vreti""""/""""pe cat vreti"""". So that may or may not be valid. I personally would say """"pe tot ce vretsi"""". But I don't know if it's real.

 I suppose this is part of an expression, such as """"jur pe tot ce vrei"""" or """"pun pariu pe tot ce vrei"""". Anyway, both sound common enough in Romanian and sounds pretty subjective choosing one for Romanian and one for Moldovan.  

Now, neither of those expressions is """"made up"""". He takes both from M. Bruchis' work, """"one step back, two steps forward"""" which is also quite critical of the notion of an independent Moldovan language.

 But can this author prove they exist? Probably not, since no google hits are found.  

 Michael Bruchis, you mean? I'm sure he can. He's an expert, too. He wrote an entire book on the subject. Just because no Google hits exist doesn't mean an expression isn't real  do you find any Google results for cit vreti%22+site%3A.md or cat vreti%22+site%3A.md? Or even tot ce vreti%22+site%3A.md? No, you don't. But that doesn't mean that nobody says those things in Moldova. How many results do you find for """"instrumente gramaticale""""? 37, and none of them are at .md websites. You can find the word """"cuvintelnic"""" on Google, but does that mean it's really the Moldovan word for """"dictionar""""? No, Moldovan ppl only use that word when we're joking. (dexonline.ro finds 0 results too). Just because a term occurs or doesn't occur on Google, doesn't mean it is or isn't real.  

""""sovetul"""" is not a misspelling. Rather, it's a Soviet-era spelling  """"soviet"""" was spelt as """"sovet"""". Some Moldovans still spell it that way although it's usually considered incorrect; however he is quoting the phrase from Bruchis, who published his work a bit earlier when the spelling was still accepted.  

I agree with your opinion. Such an ignorant person like """"expert Dyer"""" can't be called expert. talk & contribs

Feel free to discuss your questions directly with me by email if you like (wiki lets you do this by clicking a link). I used a variety of references obtained via Google, which I did not list in the article (I probably should have).

I have doubts about some of the information that was there before my changes and that you have restored. In particular, I believe that Skene's glands are not the same as the G-spot, and are not located there. However, stimulation of the G-spot can cause female ejaculation, which generates fluid from the Skene's glands (among other tissues).

Please, by all means include it. Is lack of something from """"Blitzers side"""" a reason to exclude citicism and delete a large chunk of the article? I dont think so. Unless you can actually defend your changes citing policy you will need to revert them. 

To clarify, yes, Near East Report is an AIPAC publication, as I said four days ago. Whether it was published by AIPAC in the 70s, I don't know, although it is likely. What we do know is that Blitzer started working for the JPost in 1973. He may very well have edited a version of """"Myths & Facts"""" in 1976, by the way, en edition of that book was published every two years. Plenty of journalists do outside work. Keep in mind that we are an encyclopedia. You need a reliable source thats says who he worked for and the dates. Pulling this information together from different primary sources is original research. You cannot quote somebody as calling Near East Report a """"propaganda sheet"""" any more than another editor can say """"Belfast is inhabited by """"drunken and violent"""" Irish people with the quote cited to Thomas Nast. You also can't cite three people attacking Blitzer's scholarship in Territory of Lies without any response from Blitzer or his supporters.  

Firstly, I wont respond to your silly example referring to where I live. Your racism is disgusting and reflects only on you but thats your problem.

Secondly, please dont further insult the intelligence of editors by implying that Near East Report was *possibly* published by someone else in 1970s. Blitzer edited the book ergo he worked for AIPAC, likewise he was editor of the weekly publication Near East Report into 1978. Source? The directoy listing showing his name listed as the responsible party at the weekly. He worked for them in 1976,77,78 regardless of whether you seek to portray that as """"outside work"""" or anything else. His name is on the front cover of the book as editor right? His name is listed in the weekly publication as editor right? Are those facts in dispute by you? 

Friedmans words are his own, you removed not only the quote whos inclusion you disagree with but all the other details. Fine, remove the quote, but removing everything else? Criticism of Blitzer does belong in the section detailing criticism. An automatic rebuttal isnt necessarily required if its a minority view and/or it cant be located.

What is a ballast house? How many times do I have to tell you? Solid evidence please.   
 a ballast house is where they keep the stones placed under tracks. they are now used for track marshalls when they are working on the track - hence they now have windows. there are plenty of them around and like i said there is one where denvilles station was.  
 on the picture you can see a clearing where the station building and platform foundations still exist. some of them blue bricks are still around. the blue bricks were common on the also disused section of the metropolitan line near amersham so it could have been designed by the same architech  
What picture? I am getting a bit fed up of being told what you can see on the ground. Just find me three articles on the web that mention this station. (You name me any other closed English railway station and I will give you half a dozen links to it.)   

This station does not exist according to a Railatlas (OPC 10th edition) and Quail (latest Southern Region edition). Quail lists ALL old stations. I ride the line frequently and there is nothing of interest in the marked area.  

 Possible signal boxes 

Are there any level crossings in Denvilles needing a signal box to interlock it.  All things considered, under the Block Telegraph system of safeworking, such a box would allow a train to advance closer to the junction at Havant from the previous station at Rowlands Castle railway station, which is quite a long way away.

Denvilles railway station existed between 1858 and 1859 only, though there are remains there to this day.  That might explain the paucity of sources on the internet, though I've found one and added it..

How this article can shine

 Use information from the school's website.   Yes, the school's website sucks, but there is some info there.
 Use information from the local newspapers, the Trib, Chron, and other local publications.
 Use information from the school newspaper, yearbook, and literary journal.   The great thing about this is students can get things in here that otherwise would go underreported.   These all have editorial oversight so they are """"reliable"""" as far as wikipedia cares.   (unlike a student's blog)

Let's start over...

This is not going anywhere, except towards mediation. Though I agree more or less completely with Justin's edits, you both need to calm down. The spelling/language issue is pointless, as are the insults, as are the reverts, and the misleading and/or rude edit summaries. Who cares which version is online for two or three hours, if it's going to be reverted anyway once this debate is completed? So let's focus on the debate, and leave the page at some point where we are all familiar with the content, and then do changes step-by-step. To improve the mood here, I think Daryou should accept that there may be some spelling errors in his texts, while Koavf really needs to respect that Daryou's not a native speaker, and not harass him over this. (And I need to stop sounding like my mom.)
 Mincom, the Moroccan government's own site, is of course propaganda, by every definition of the word, but that doesn't mean it can't be used as a source - for what Morocco's government thinks and says. On the other hand, pasting hole chunks of text from it as fact, is obviously not how this should be done.
 Inserting that Western Sahara was """"peacefully ... liberated"""" by Morocco is also betraying an agenda that is far more biased than your edits have been so far, Daryou. I think you've been trying to make that point all along, consistently in all of your edits, but you used to be better at hiding it.
 Questions remain above to be answered, with arguments, not reverts or insults.
 That's my input for today, and, yes, I think mediation could be a good thing. I was hoping we could settle this one through discussion (it has worked before!), but I've lost hope by now.

I could make a case for Wikipedia being harmed more by religious or political advocacy editing than by paid advocacy editing (but see below for why I think this might change).
There are however, a couple of things that are special about paid advocacy editing which IMO require extra care.
First, Scientology cannot do anything to suddenly have ten times more followers. They are already doing the best they can and the pool of potential converts is resistant.
Paid advocacy editing, on the other hand, can easily gain as many paid advocacy editors as desired by simply paying more. Think of the difference between getting emails advocating politics or religion vs. emails about online pharmacies. The first is annoying, but self limiting; the second gets bigger and bigger as long as it remains profitable. Our article on Email spam gives numbers like 200 billion spam messages sent per day and 97% of all emails being unwanted. I think Jimbo is right to be especially concerned over something that could grow exponentially.
Second, we really cannot do anything to convince most religion or politics advocates to change their ways other than blocking or banning them, but we can make big changes in how paid advocacy editors operate. If it becomes well known that the advocacy editors who don't edit articles directly but instead make talk page requests get better results and that the sneaky kind of paid advocacy editor usually gets reverted, the customers will naturally go with the service that gets the best results. We can make that happen, but again it takes special care."

This was never meant to turn into an essay or a Big Deal. However, in September, I decided to reveal to the WP community that I'd been on antidepressant medication, and have had an 'interesting' history regarding depression and self-injury. Another editor, now banned, had decided to take it upon himself to bully me over the fact that yes, I have had a history of depression and that I was popping pills like smarties. Obviously, it was something to be ashamed of and something which made me a lesser person, an unstable and unworthy one.

I decided to tell the truth, then take a break. I'd never have foreseen what was going to happen next.

The community spoke out, and spoke out clearly and pretty much with one voice. Of the list of people below who commented, I see dear friends, strangers and people who are vehemently set against each other - all saying the same thing.

When I came back here, I was just going to delete my public statement, check for fallout and (hopefully) get back to work. However, I'm keeping it here as a message to all others who have been through this too, or are going through it right now. My email inbox is filled up right now with """"me too"""" messages from all sorts of people on here; editors, admins, even two chronic vandals, and all in a very similar situation.

This is what the community has to say;

To other people out there who are hiding or are afraid or ashamed of what people might think, or are feeling worthless and unloved, read through the list below, because so many of these good people are also speaking to you.

I want to thank everyone here for being so loving, trusting and supportive of me here. I truly don't know what to say ...

Love you all,

Public statement

Hi all,

This is just a statement here, there's no need for commentary or WikiDrahmaz. Recently an abusive editor created sock-puppet accounts to make accusations against me here on my talk page (and on theirs). They were reverted pretty quickly by my alert friends )

and

Now my take on this is as follows; with all trolls, vandals and weirdos, the proper approach is revert, block, ignore and generally move on. Nothing to see here, folks. Every editor on WP, admins included, has a right to anonymity, privacy of their personal information and to be able to edit here without harassment or personal attacks. This is a fundamental tenet of Wikipedia and is non-negotiable."

That is the kind of material WP:WAF expects. And that material is suited for prose. Including some examples is fine, but listing them all (especially in bullet-point form) is unnecessary.

Matthew 1:25; notice the word until, indicates Mary did not remain a virgin her whole life. 

Some haved to tried to argue their way out of that truth. Thought the gospels several times point fact. However scholars have noted two things about the theories, that Mary borne no other children: One there is a motivate behind such theories, to uphold a doctrine that arouse much later; the church teaching that Mary remained a virigin throught her life. Two, the theories themselves do not hold up to under scrutiny for example, one such theory suggests that the brothers in question were step brothers, sons of Joseph by a earlier marriage. This notion lacks substance for it would it would actually deny Jesus the legal right of inherit the kingship of David, another theory is, that were actually cousins of Jesus although the Greek scriptures use distinct words for brother, cousin, and relative. Thus scholar Frank E. Gableline calls these theological theories far fetched he concludes the most natural way to understand brother is that term refers to sons of Mary and Joseph they were brothers of Jesus on his mother’s side.

Matt. 13:53-56, Jerusalem Bible: “When Jesus had finished these parables he left the district; and, coming to his home town, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a way that they were astonished and said, ‘Where did the man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? This is the carpenter’s son, surely? Is not his mother the woman called Mary, and his brothers [Greek, a•del•phoi´] James and Joseph and Simon and Jude? His sisters [Greek, a•del•phai´], too, are they not all here with us?’” (On the basis of this text, would you conclude that Jesus was Mary’s only child or that she had other sons as well as daughters?)

The New Catholic Encyclopedia (1967, Vol. IX, p. 337) admits regarding the Greek words a•del•phoi´ and a•del•phai´, used at Matthew 13:55, 56, that these “have the meaning of full blood brother and sister in the Greek-speaking world of the Evangelist’s time and would naturally be taken by his Greek reader in this sense. Toward the end of the 4th century (c. 380) Helvidius in a work now lost pressed this fact in order to attribute to Mary other children besides Jesus so as to make her a model for mothers of larger families. St. Jerome, motivated by the Church’s traditional faith in Mary’s perpetual virginity, wrote a tract against Helvidius (A.D. 383) in which he developed an explanation . . . that is still in vogue among Catholic scholars.”
Mark 3:31-35, JB: “His mother and brothers now arrived and, standing outside, sent in a message asking for him. A crowd was sitting round him at the time the message was passed to him, ‘Your mother and brothers and sisters are outside asking for you’. He replied, ‘Who are my mother and my brothers?’ And looking round at those sitting in a circle about him, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers. Anyone who does the will of God, that person is my brother and sister and mother.’” (Here a clear distinction is drawn between Jesus’ natural brothers and his spiritual brothers, his disciples. No one claims that the reference to Jesus’ mother means anything different from what it says. Is it consistent, then, to reason that his natural brothers were not that but were perhaps cousins? When what is meant is not brothers but relatives, a different Greek word [syg•ge•non´] is used, as at Luke 21:16.)"

 Comments on Mediation

 Major Restructuring 
Major resturcturing of this article was long overdue.  The article was almost entirely one long, long section, ironically called """"Overview"""".  I completely restructured this article to be more in line with the common Wikipedia structure used for other television programs.  Most notably The Simpsons and M*A*S*H (TV series) were used as examples of shows that were very popular and well organized.  I attempted to use logic in the categries and their order.  This reorganization was definitely needed, but it meant a lot of the content had to be moved around but I did not remove any content (yet) (except for correcting the episode of The Danny Thomas Show as being the pilot.  It was the basis for the a new show, possibly categoried as a spin-off, but it wasn't a pilot episode of TAGS).  

I added some new content but I did not remove existing content because I figured this restructuring was such a major change that I figured to take one step at a time.   Please note that I did not move everything.  All content that was not moved (most of it) was left where it was but the section was renamed """"Commentary"""".  I did not want to change too much all at once.  Much of that content is indeed commentary (not strictly factual) but some of it is still needs to be moved to more appropriate sections or deleted if duplicate information.
 

Thanks for the hard work.  I wanted to work on this some time ago, but because of the situation recounted above that went to the Mediation Cabal and the """"truce"""" proposed I have been reluctant to make any changes here.  Nice to see others are of the same mind.   

Yeah, it looks a lot better.  Just prior to its restructuring, I added a bunch of stuff to fill out the article, because it seemed a little light (for as popular a show as it is), and also simply because the Sheriff Andy Taylor link redirects here, but there was very little content about the character on this page.  But I didn't know where to put anything, so I just kind of stuck stuff here and there.  I hope I didn't add any duplicate information. Please feel free to move it around or take it out if it isn't necessary.  

 New (Big) Problem re: Episodes List 
The list of Andy Griffith episodes was apparently started in October 2005.  Many different people have worked hard on it, and it has always been the only episodes list linked to from The Andy Griffith Show.

As I was revising the structure of The Andy Griffith Show (see above) I noticed that the list of episodes was actually misnamed.  It is, and has always been, located at List of Andy Griffith Show episodes.  Please notice that the mistake is that the word """"The"""" was missing from the title (The name of the show is """"The Andy Griffith Show"""").  Noticing this I decided correct the problem by moving the article to include the word """"The"""" in the title, and I later planned on correcting the link on the main show's article.  However when I tried this I was surprised to discover that I couldn't do that because another article was already named List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes (with the """"The).

Through dumb luck (or bad luck) I discovered that another user had started creating an list of Andy Griffith episode on their own, under their username where nobody else knew it existed.  This article was started after the original and was basically hidden from others.  Just this month the user that created the alternate episodes list moved their article to List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes, although the main show's article still doesn't point to it.

So there's the situation.  We've got two lists of episodes.  What to do?  Pros and Cons while staying neutral:  The original list is mistitled but has always been the only list linked to from the main article at The Andy Griffith Show.  Because it was always public more different people have worked on it.  The newer article is almost as old but it was """"hidden"""" in a user area until just this month.  I will admit that the newer article looks nicer in style, structure, colors, etc. but IMHO I think the descriptions are better in the older, public list,"

Adult Film Career Revision Proposal

This paragraph needs editing.  It has several problems

 Moving to Germany had nothing to do with Adult films.
 This sentence is superflous:  """"Other films included Man to Men and Jawbreaker.""""
 This sentence seems to be selling the films or gratuitously promoting them. """"Scenes from some films have been re-released as part of compilations which is common in the porn industry. The compilation Touched by an Anal was released in 1997; a more recent release was in 2006, Mansex Meltdown.""""
 This sentence has nothing to do with the Adult Film Career heading: """"Though he has appeared in gay and bisexual porn films, Sanchez identifies as heterosexual and has stated that he has had no homosexual contact since joining the Corps in 2003.""""

Re-write for Adult Career 2.0

So, we could re-write:

In the early 1990's, Matt Sanchez lived in Montreal, Canada where he worked in the adult entertainment industry in all-male films for prominent directors John Rutherford and Kristen Bjorn and Chi Chi Larue at the studios Bijou, Catalina and Falcon Video.  For French-speaking films, he used the stage name Pierre LaBranche, but all of his titles in the United States were under Rod Majors.   

During his career, Sanchez stared in several award-winning adult films including Call of the Wild, Jawbreaker and Idol Country co-starring Ryan Idol and Marco Rossi. 

Scenes from many films have recently been re-released as part of compilations; Sanchez stated in an interview with Radar Magazine that it """"was just the nature of the business, you shoot a lot of films and they use them forever."""" Sanchez later wrote, """"In porn, everything taboo is trivialized and everything trivial is magnified.""""

It's too hard for me to puzzle through all the German text relevant to this case (which Google Translate handles far more poorly than Chinese or Arabic, alas).

Guys a Arvanite that says I'am Greek its not a Arvanit but a Greek!The ancestors of the arvanites where Albanian farmers and highlanders from Toskëria and Epirus!My great-grandfather was Arvanit..Arbanitika belongs to the linguistic family of Albanian.The first Christian Albanian migrations to central and southern(note: Albanian of north-western Greece are on Albanian native lands) of what is today Greek territory took place as early as the XI-XII centuries (Trudgill, 1975:5; Banfi, 1994:19), although the main ones most often mentioned in the bibliography happened in the XIV-XV centuries, when Albanians were invited to settle in depopulated areas by their Byzantine, Catalan or Florentine rulers (Tsitsipis, 1994:1; Trudgill, 1975:5; Nakratzas, 1992:20-24 & 78-90; Banfi, 1994:19). According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by Albanians (Trudgill, 1975:6). Another wave of Albanian migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in the XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). All these Albanians are the ancestors of modern-day Arbanites in Central and Southern Greece.

When the modern Greek state was formed, the Albanian-speaking population and its language were called Albanian .Bickford-Smith, 1993: 47; Embeirikos, 1994; Vakalopoulos, 1994:243-249). However, the policy of the new Greek state was to Hellenize all the non-Greek speaking Orthodox populations within its, then limited, territory as well as in the territories of Epirr, Macedonia, Thrace and Asia Minor still under Ottoman rule). As elsewhere in Europe, army and education were the most effective mechanisms of Hellenization, assisted by the judiciary system ready to denounce and punish all forms of behavior inconsistent with the state’s nationalist culture (Kitromilidis, 1990:38; Kollias, 1994).
check this:http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Arvanitika or this http://www.traboini.com/al/public_02.html or ARVANITET By Irakli Kocollari Reviewed by Dr. Arben Kallamata 

If u are Arvanit than translate this,my grandpa used to sing it to me:Moj e bukura Moré, si të lash më s´të pashë, si të lash, si të lash, si të lash më s´të pashë...  rri o laman se sje Arvanit ti po ik e shkërdheu me gjith Grek! The fustanella is albanian! The most maniotes are of arvanite origin, the have same customes as the northern albanian highlanders and the montenegrin highlanders! 

Theodor Kollokotroni was atleast partially Albanian, one of his grandparents was from Delvina, southern Albania! He considered the albanians as his """"brothers by blood""""! BUT HEY I won't bother with facts here,anymore,they are no good for a bunch on ultra-nationalist whatsoever.They even like Slav more than us, and my great-grandfathers had fought for Greece,all I have to say F-em.

 From the Members
Welcome to the Ninth issue of the WikiProject Christianity newsletter! Use this newsletter as a mechanism to inform yourselves about progress at the project and please be inspired to take more active roles in what we do.  

I am in the process of going through the various categories related to Christianity. I am finding that several of them may not have sufficient number of members to continue. By the end of the month, I hope to have the main category list finished (yeah, it might take that long, it's huge). At that time, I think we will review all the categories and see which may not have sufficient articles to continue. Please feel free to take part in the discussion regading what the minimum number of category items is, and how to deal with the non-qualifying categories, on the General Forum page.

I looked at the wiki mediation but it is all a waste of energy against anyone that is willing to spend the hours he has done putting together an entirely erroneous and dishonest RfC against Canaen.

But I think I will write to the foundation and find out who their legal counsel because what he has written against Canaen is pure indelible libel. Whereas mediation is a waste of time, the foundation will jump if they start receiving legal letters requesting user contact details. They have to be law.

I approached both of them, him and Skinwaker very reasonably in the first place and straight off received the same modus operandi. he is what he shows himself to be. BTW, I have absolutely no connection with Canaen or anyone else but I recognise decency and indeceny when I see it.

Oppose this proposal. I would support however some sort of guidelines for arbs (and maybe admins) regarding what sort of complaints are clear reason for status change, and what are perhaps valid but less clearcut, and then, if the latter, some sort of discussion, maybe per RfC with a crat closing, regarding the conduct of the individual involved and how to deal with it. Personally, I think the """"us"""" AGK used is potentially problematic, but could just be, potentially, a typo. Arbs are not necessarily required to write all comments like legal briefs, particularly if they themselves are not necessarily lawyers. Of course, if AGK, or any other arb in a potentially similar position, were to resign on their own, should that happen, that might be enough to address that specific situation, but no one should see my saying that as necessarily indicating I think such would necessarily be the way to proceed in this instance, because I don't think the matter necessarily rises to that level.

As for WP:V for making claims about people, I just find that seriously bizarre. You are saying Wikipedia logs are not reliable sources for what Wikipedia editors do? That's pretty ridiculous. The log information stating exactly that information is precisely what readers would have to have had to look at (if they knew how to do it) to even understand the article. Finally, as for not using self references, look at the article context. It was quite clearly nonsense not to refer to the fact that that article had only existed for a few hours. How can you not self reference in that situation? Or are you honestly saying that was not pertinent information, about a claim being made about an article having existed or not?

You're on an encyclopaedia. It's Wikipedia's job to explain things. While we do try to limit spoilers, there's usually not much we can to do and searching Wikipedia for something will tend to spoil it. I read Star Trek XI's plot before watching it because I knew it would be on the site. The problem is the same with any encyclopaedia in the world. If you can spot a really major spoiler, then by all means, point it out and we'll see if we can fix it. Otherwise, leave it as is. Besides, after a game or a film or whatever is out for a certain period of time, no-one cares about spoilers.

87837,"""== Re: Telstra Article ==

Hello. I am new to Wiki but thought I had read the T&Cs; fairly well. I am surprised at the number of citations you are demanding for my edit to the Telstra mobile page. Many of the facts you are seeing citations for are indesputible engineering realities and hence you wont find a seperate statement from someone claiming same (although you may find news paper articles backing some of the claims). The points made about 850 having superior coverage to 2100 cant be disputed and I would ask since that being the case, what sort of citation should I be looking for to back up the statement?

I accept referencing Whirlpool for carrier customer numbers is a bit slack. The only reason I did that was that in that discussion thread was a neatly pulled together list of each carriers end of year reports showing their customer base - which highlighted the point that Telstra is the largest carrier by subscriber base at this time. Considering that it is not appropriate to reference a forum thread, how can I best reference this to Wikipedia's satisfaction?

I also note that you removed the citations that pointed back to Telstra.com. The third party aspect of your requirement there is almost not appropriate when you are refering to direct history or a Telstra product reference on the topic. Specifically, the references to Telstra having the first automated mobile network are hard to find anywhere else but on Telstra's media pages - because quite frankly no other operator is going to want to talk about it, and no other Australian source of any repute exists on the internet that would be bothered backing up such claims that I have been able to find (again I dont like quoting news papers because there is no traceability as to the reliability of their sources in the first place - an encyclopedia based on newspapers is a sure way to enshrine into history some editors' warped viewpoint which may or may not be right, but someone reading something and seeing a reference pointing at a news paper may not recognise as simply being another editors point of view.

Please, can you outline how I can more effectively cite elements of my contribution and to an extent justify your requirements for citations where I have not yet been able to find any suitable meaningful references?
   

Hi. I'm not sure if you have checked out Wikipedia:Reliable sources which also links to many other wiki policies. If there is a few lines in the article which is in a source you can cite it more then once using [cite information here] once then adding  on the other sentences with in the article. 

Whirlpool isn't a reliable source but other if it links to a source you could use that source instead but as long as it's reliable source and a third party source.  

Websites Telstra and any company it owns isn't a third party source which can be seen a bias and can be seen as a point of view which it way we use third party sources (See Self-published sources).

Newspapers can be used whether or not it's a website or you can just reference the title of the article, name of the paper, page, date it was printed and who the story was written by, As you can trace Newspapers who's stories may not be online or the story was before the internet was around. I hope this helps.

5232,"In Japan, Nobukatsu Fujioka, a professor of Takushoku University, mentioned, “Many translated books are published in Japan but Iris Chang’s “The Rape of Nanking” is not published. Because, it has so many mistakes that no publisher could have handled it. The photos are all false, and not a single picture was an evidence of the ‘Nanking Massacre.’ Not only that, her description about Japanese history is filled with absurd mistakes. For instance, she wrote that the Japanese military strength before the end of the Edo era (1603 -1867) had not exceeded the level of sword, bow and arrow (in fact, Japan was the biggest producer of guns in the world already in the 16th century). More than 100 such rudimentary mistakes were found in the book, and even if the book is published in Japan, no Japanese people could bear reading it. A left-wing publishing company tried to publish it with notes annotated by translator, but she refused it saying, “How impertinent.” Sad to say, the Americans trust such a book and are making movies.”
 
Shoichi Watanabe, a professor emeritus of Jochi University, mentioned, “Before World War II, a false document called the Tanaka Memorial was made in China. This was a purported Japanese strategic planning document from 1927, in which Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka laid out for Emperor Hirohito a strategy to take over the world. The American President Roosevelt, senators and congressmen read this forgery, and believed the lie that Japan had a malicious intention to take over Asia and the world. That became a cause for the US-Japan war. It is said that after reading it, Roosevelt decided to defeat Japan entirely. Iris Chang’s ‘The Rape of Nanking’ is the same. If we leave this lie as it is, it will certainly give a bad influence to the US-Japan relation.”"

The real issue here is that OFSTED reports are primary sources, just as the Crested report is a primary source. We have a situation where editors are each trying to interpret these primary sources and adding their own spin in line with their own opinions. It's really neither here nor there what I think or what Fmph thinks, it is how the primary sources are interpreted in secondary sources that counts. We effectively have original research here where editors are try to interpret these reports themselves and cite from them selectively and not setting the reports in the appropriate context. To answer Sailmfadhley's question, OFSTED reports do sometimes get reported in local newspapers, usually if they receive an outstanding rating or if the school is put into special measures. I can't find any newspaper reports relating to the inspections at Woodleigh. It tends to be the worst-performing schools that attract the attention of secondary sources. For The Ridings School for example it is entirely appropriate to quote from OFSTED reports as they were widely cited in the national press. There might well be a need to cite the latest inspection report but in this case the most recent report is rather brief and focused on issues like flooring, bathing facilities and the general state of the accommodation rather than the education of the pupils. We don't normally include information about such matters in school articles. This is also not by any means a typical OFSTED report. All the OFSTED reports for this school have a much narrower focus than the usual OFSTED reports as they are concerned primarily with the boarding provision and the related health and safety and child welfare issues which in itself offers an unbalanced view of the school. Normally independent schools get inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate, but I cannot find any recent report from the ISI.   18:04"

There is a confusion between the different definitions of heterosexuality.  I think this article should be worded more like the homosexuality article, which distinguishes between homosexual orientation and same-sex relationships.  Likewise, there needs to be a distinction between people with a heterosexual orientation and people who have sexual relationships with people of the opposite gender.  I think if we reorganize the page like the homosexual page this distinction would be more clear.  For example, it would make clear that reproduction results from heterosexual sex, not from a heterosexual orientation.  On the other hand, the causality section is mostly about the development of a heterosexual orientation.  That crucial element isn't clear.

As a practitioner in this field for over 20 years and editor/author of The Handbook of MultiSource Feedback, I strongly disagree with the statement that 360 cannot succeed as a tool for decision making. Many organizations have and continue to use 360 for decision making, including not only appraisal but also succession planning, high potential selection/development, staffing, and leadership development. The fact is that 360 data, generated under the right conditions (including things like rater training), provides information that is more valid and fair than that created by traditional sources (i.e., supervisor evaluations). Yes, it can be misused and abused, which is true for any tool/process. And it is difficult to do well and to sustain it. But it is overly dogmatic to dismiss it as useful only for development.

Subsequently Eleland came along and deleted most of your modifications claiming that they were not from authoritative enough sources and that they were disproportionate within the article. Eleland made a unilateral decision about all this and was quite perturbed when I reinstated the article. Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out. Please check discussion for Admin's response. I do not question anything said by Manning, however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as Fluri. Also Eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations. 

Admittedly, I have responded vigorously in discussion, but only to protect the material that had already been checked by Fluri. Anyway it appears that Eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record. This is somewhat surprising given Eleland's herculean efforts to include material about Israel on the Caterpillar.Inc issue. Clearly Eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under """"Ed O'Loughlin"""" but a bit of an anti-Israel activist himself. 

This is perhaps strange considering, and I quote:  Editors must not remove information about an argument because they personally disagree with the argument. Wikipedia must include all notable points of view which appear in verifiable published sources. Reporting that activists have said something does not imply that the activists are correct. Removing those reports because you think the activists aren't correct contradicts Wikipedia's core policies. Eleland

39523,"Pesher theory, Satanic Attack or Religion Novice
One could interpret Dr Thiering's pesher theory as a Satanic attack
to discredit deity in religion... at best. Or one could simply chalk
it down to a novice babbling away.

From St Augustine through 1,000s of saints and experts, deeper understanding
reveals divinity to be real, including that of Jesus and heaven, etc.

The final proof then will be in the Second Coming which pesher theory would
equate to only a human being who is a larger teacher of mankind; but when
Christ comes again shortly and creates endless miracles, as healing across
the entire face of the earth, such tripe as pesher will be seen to be 
what it is, babble, from someone who has no depth of understanding of 
religion."

I'm going to pretend for just a moment, Fred, that you'd actually be interested in my advice. Please don't feel any need to insult me over this  I don't have any real belief that your interested in anything I have to say.

But anyway, in this imaginary world where you actually are interested in my advice, I would tell you that, in the capacity of an arbitrator, you've written a summary of the focus of the dispute that (a) includes an alleged statement of the opinion of one party to the dispute that that party has denied, and that (b) the other side of the dispute seems to think is inaccurate. Again in this imaginary world, I would suggest to you that maybe it would be more productive to re-write the damn summary that no one likes rather than, say, to write a new article about Wikilawyering.

Back to this world, now. I'm going to spend a day or so trying to get El C to write the second notice to you, just because I think it would be good for him to do it. I don't think he will, but I noted to you that I wouldn't start looking for someone to write the second notice to you for a day or two, so I'll spend that time """"mentoring"""" El C before I seriously start looking.

In fairness, I think I should tell you that, while I do think you are absolutely wrong in this particular matter, and I really will pursue it to the very end, I find your attitude pretty amusing, and it is entertaining for me (in some dark way, perhaps) to see the innovative and gymnastic things you come up with in order to avoid doing what seems to me to be quite obviously the right thing to do. I'm telling you this because possibly you find the whole thing very annoying and draining  as indeed I would, if I were continually having to make up new reasons for not doing what is obviously the right thing to do  and if that's the case, this could be a bad situation for you: you're drained while I'm entertained. Now, probably some worthy will turn my words here against me, and claim (ignoring my clear statement that I think you are absolutely wrong in this particular matter) that I am just trying to be annoying to you. But I can deal with that, and it really is as a favor to you that I've informed you that I think this whole process is amusing to me.

 As I posted in the discussion page of that page, for calling Chinese state media as propaganda, I can say the same for the western media.

At the same time, it is also ridiculous (and insulting) to consider it as propaganda.

 I am curious, the CIA fact book states that the USA is 81.7% white 12.9% black, 4.2% Asian, and 2% others? This adds up to about 100%, what happened to all the Mexicans, and Hispanics? Are they saying that ones a Mexican crosses over the border he or she becomes white? that makes no sense. At what percentage does a mestizo become white, 50%, 75%, or 90%? According to the U.S census if a Mexican marks Mexican on the U.S Census, he or she will be classified as white. This leads to my final question, shouldn’t then most Mexicans be classified white, according to the CIA? Finally, I have been to several parts in Mexico and I have noticed that many, or the majority of Mexicans in central Mexico look whiter than Italians, French and middle eastern, which are classified as white everywhere. A large percentage of the Argentinean population has Amerindian mixture; doesn't that make them Mestizo's? Any ways, we will never know for sure until a large genetic sample is taken. I agree with having a predominate 35-45%; if you look at the Argentina demographics it states that 57% of the population has Amerindian ancestry, but 85-97% of the population states that they are white?

109487,"I appreciate you taking the time to have a look at the edit history. Yes Codf1977 was always very active whilst 'semi-retired, but although they made a couple of edits after their 'retirement' their activity had fallen off almost completely (predictably one of their very few 'retirement' edits was to revert an action that I had made here: []) and on quite a few days there was no activity at all on the account. 

 VHarris44 was clearly not someone completely new to Wikipedia. That much is very clear from their skill in navigating Wikipedia, such as posting a help request on their talk page and posting Advert tags on articles, right from the first day of their activity. This is someone who had prior experience on Wikipedia. It is also I believe reasonably well established that VHarris44's behaviour towards me was inappropriate, they were afterall permanently blocked for their behaviour and four requests by them for a reversal were turned down. There is also the issue of VHarris44 having known details about my university. Did they really find this from looking through the history of my talk page? That has to be extremely unlikely. 

 So the obvious question is, who is VHarris44? A very logical possibility is, another experienced user that I have serious disagreements with. To my knowledge there is only one user in that category. Now in view of the timing of that user's retirement, the fact that that retirement quickly followed their failure to succeed in getting a page that I had created deleted, the fact that one of the only edits during their retirement was to undo one of my edits, and the fact that they then remerged so quickly following my difficulties with VHarris44, this is all very strong circumstantial evidence that VHarris44 and Codf1977 are the same person.  So was Codf1977's detailed exposition of their view of my dealings with VHarris44 here: User talk:TFOWR#Rangoon11's filing of Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Codf1977 and his other actions yesterday.

 In terms of the spelling mistakes made by VHarris44, I have looked again myself and concede that I cannot immediately find examples of the same spelling mistake in Codf1977's writing, but equally I cannot find exactly the same text written by Codf1977 in which those mistakes occurred (i.e. I can't find an example of Codf1977 saying 'no one agrees with you' or 'know one agrees with you'). They both seem to have poor spelling. 'such big changes must be agreed in talk page' is an edit description which both Codf1977 and VHarris44 have used. Ultimately there is little text written by VHarris44 to go on though. 

 I do not believe it a absolute certainly that Codf1977 and VHarris44 are the same person, merely that the circumstantial evidence in that direction is very strong. I can accept that others do not feel the evidence sufficient. However I have been blocked on the grounds of harrassment for making a complaint based upon that circumstantial evidence. That seems very unfair, for even though others may not believe that there is sufficient evidence that Codf1977 and VHarris44 are the same person, I really struggle to see that others cannot see the circumstantial evidence that I saw and therefore relate to why I felt compelled to post a message on the admin board."

You told me that I shouldn't write edits about general discussion on the talk pages of articles in Wikipedia. But this time it was different. Whereas last time you were talking about the talk pages of articles, this time we are talking about the talk pages of users. Whereas article talk pages were general and public, user talk pages were personal and private. They were different and very different from each other. I thought they were personal and private. I thought they were different and very different from each other. When you said that talk pages were not for general discussion, I thought you were just talking about the talk pages of articles, not the talk pages of users. Although general discussion wasn't allowed in the talk pages of articles, which were public, I thought they would be okay in the talk pages of users, which were personal and private. I thought you would not mind me having general discussion in a personal and private part of Wikipedia, or at least not too much or as much as in a public part. That was one reason why I didn’t thought what you told me in the article talk page meant that I shouldn’t make the edits then in the talk pages of those users.

What I did in those edits was sending, telling, and giving messages and requests, not general discussion. I thought it wasn't general discussion. That was different, perhaps very different, from general discussion, or discussion of any sort. I thought it was different. Whereas discussion is two-way and consists of several people talking together, sending messages is, or can be, just one-way, involving and being done by just one person, or both. Whereas discussion needs or involves response or repliance, sending messages doesn't need or involve sending responses or replies. The user of the talk page doesn't need to write anything in response, I just wanted him to read it and do what it asked him to. The messages and requests sent were not general either. They were special and specific, sent for a special reason about a special subject in a special time and situation. Those were not general discussion also because they were done in the talk page of a user, not the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk. I thought that was a reason why they weren’t discussion. If it was done in the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk, it would probably be discussion because it was one person talking and dicussing about this to lots of other people and a group in Wikipedia and telling and encouraging them to tell and discuss about it with each other, in a public place. But it was done in the talk page of a user, it would be just sending and telling a message because it was just with one other person and telling and saying something personally and individually to him, one way, in a private place. I thought you would not mind me having general discussion in a personal and private part of Wikipedia, or at least not too much or as much as in a public part.

Although you may think what I did in the user talk pages was very bad, it's not really that bad. I thought it was not really that bad, wrong, and serious, especially if it was just done once or only very rarely. That was one reason why I did and would have done those edits on the user talk pages. I didn't really know and understand how bad you would think it would be. I didn’t think it would be really that bad. I thought it would just either result in no response from you, another warning from you, or a block that is at least not indefinite. There were actually several reasons why it's not really that bad, or at least I thought it wasn't that bad. First, it would not have actually made any real difference or bad effect to Wikipedia or its general and public contents, facts, statements, and information, etc. It wasn't damage or disruption because it was adding information, not changing or removing information. It was added in a user talk page, a place for adding messages and not for containing facts about one specific topic. Second, it was done in the personal and private part of Wikipedia. It would be just the users of the talk pages themselves who would see, read, and look at those edits, or would just need to do so, and so you don't really even need to care or mind about it, at least not too much. Third, they probably would not mind or dislike those edits onto their talk pages, or they might even be glad to see them. Fourth, even if they didn't like having those edits being on their talk pages, they could simply delete and remove it, or perhaps also make a copy of it and place it somewhere else, or simply just ignore it. Fifth, if you don't like them you could simply go to my Special:Contributions and quickly delete all of those edits. Those were several reasons why I thought they were not really that bad, wrong, and serious.

I guess JFD is trying to discourage you to get in touch with me via e-mail, since he fears some kind of academical threat. Just to clear some things up, I was not the guy who went """"India did not exist until 1947"""". I would never post something as blunt, offensive, and ignorant as that. However, yes, I have changed a few things around as a correction. It is not to offend anyone, but like Kenneth Tennyson and his devoted sidekick JFD (the Green Hornet and Kato), I too have some historical points of views. I understand that you have been accused of being a pan-Indian nationalist, while I have been accused of being a Tamil nationalist. As far as Indian martial arts are concerned, martial arts from both your culture and mine are in the Indian martial arts section. Therefore, it effects both of us.

It seems like through this wiki-conflict, it has thrown us together into one pot. If I am here to put you or your culture down, or to discredit India, why in the first place would I have stuck up for you. I had not intentions in mind when I did that. It just ticked me off when Kenneth sent you that messed up message. Just like, for example, a few years ago, when a Punjabi store owner was beaten up in a hate crime. I was outraged...

I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda, while I have the same for Southern India. Likewise, you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics, while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam. Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both, maybe together we can combine our knowledges to present a remarkable page. Yes, I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash. However, if we could set aside some of that and work together in a """"give-take"""" mentality we can make things work.

At the same time, we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what JFD-Kenny think, but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on Indian Martial Arts.

Do you agree with me on this? If so, it would be nice if we could communicate via e-mail. I have more ideas to share with you. I believe we can make this work. As far as JFD is concerned, I do not know what his intentions are. Maybe he feels a little threatened of the possiblity of you and me teaming up on this project? or maybe I am wrong..."""

Okay, media commentator and related matters.

He was exclusively retained by Fox News in the period immediately following the September 11 attacks, appearing on Fox programs over 100 times. He was a popular guest on the network's Special Report broadcast.Do you have any source that states all of this, and/or a collection of sources that together state this?

""""Appearing on TV news..."""" This is slightly different, since a few references to TV appearances over the years would establish that you weren't a one-time guest, but again a secondary source would help by demonstrating that TV appearances were significant.  Although I know you're not a mediæval soldier, the retainer thing is a rather specific detail that really shouldn't appear unless we have a source for it — could you find something published by Fox, or something from somewhere else, noting that they'd officially retained you?  As I noted above, I looked for sources of this sort but was unable to find them.

Also, another problem with the addition is that it is almost a verbatim copy of this web page; we are not allowed to violate whatever copyright that site holds on the information.

I'm sure you don't want an 8-page report on the differences between the various groups, so I created a diagram for your convenience. Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. In this case, I think it shows what I could scratch the surface with in about 10,000 words. Adding citations might bring it up to 12,000, but the ratios involved will always be subjective. I will never be able to get a million Jews to sign a statement that they are against Zionism, for instance, but based on the people I've talked to, I think that about 35% to 40% are. That percentage could be off, but I personally have talked to many people of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds, from all around the world, who think that the methods of the Zionists are despicable, and who will not fight with the Zionists when the end comes and the sides are chosen.

If you believe President Bush when he says, """"If you are not with us, you are against us,"""" then it looks like the sides have already been chosen. I don't think there's very many people with the side of the Crusaders and Zionists. If the only other position is against the Crusaders and Zionists, then I feel comfortable with the numbers of my side during the upcoming apocolypse.

I started this article because someone in al-Qaeda asserted that al-Qaeda is the same as the Front. It isn't, so I changed the al-Qaeda article to more accurately describe it as a subset of the Front. After that, people wanted to know what the Front was, so I started this article. I didn't put the original reference to the Front in the al-Qaeda article; I merely clarified it. There are a lot of groups in Islam that don't like the United States or Israel. I realize that its easier to combine many of these groups into a general idea when talking about them, but thinking of the larger International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders, which is really more of a movement, as the same thing as al Qaeda, is perhaps too much of a generalization. You could generalize the World Islamic Front as loose enough to be the same thing as the International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders except that the World Islamic Front only has Islamic members. That means that most of the people in Bush's """"against us"""" category could not be part of the World Islamic Front.

Your assertion that """"bin Laden certainly would have no part of such a front as you describe,"""" is absolutely untrue. bin Laden isn't a racist. He encourages any group that helps his cause and has often appealed to American and Jews to control the crimes being committed in their names by their leaders.  """

It's less objectionable, but I still have a small problem with it.  The basic problem is that is seems to imply the the PRC """"owns"""" say the history of Tang Dynasty.  Also,
it doesn't really take into account current events.  One of
the things that the PRC government has been doing in the past year has been to """"delink"""" the concept of the PRC from the concept of China.  You can see this in the response to Chen Shuibian that was issued today where the PRC was

 User:Roadrunner

 Ok, we're moving towards a solution, so that's good. As for the Tang dynasty (though I think you mean it more genral), I think that Taiwan did not form part of the Tang empire. Anyway, there's nothing against mentioning the Tang dynasty at Taiwan as well.

 We may indeed specifically include (in the history? header? """"disclaimer""""?) that the PRC avoids linking its name to China. Then again, it may de-link it formally, but all those people around the world will continue to associate the two. 

 I'll await your remaining problems with the contents, confident we'll end up with an article that satisfies the both of us (and, hopefully, """"everybody else"""").  13:07 Aug 5, 2002 (PDT)

Guys, after reading this tedious list of conversation, my sugguestion of the best way out of the naming convention of China is using those by native speakers of Chinese. As a native speaker of several dialects of Chinese, I make the following table which should help: 

How native Chinese speakers refer to:
Speakers from
Mainland China
Taiwan
HongKong
Macau

Referring to China (Mainland)
China
Mainland (daliu)
Mainland or Zhongguo Daliu (chong-gua-da-lok in Cantonese)
Mainland

Taiwan
Taiwan or Taiwan Province (the more official tone)
Taiwan
Taiwan
Taiwan

China (the culture etc., non-political issue
China
China
China
China

Most Chinese, regardless of where they are from, care less about the naming convention but some Taiwanese (like my buddy who is gonna marry next month) DO NOT WANT Mainland China to annex Taiwan and had bad impression on Chen Shuibian.

KT2

 Knowing what the Chinese call it is certainly interesting, but what is important is what the English-language people call it. 

I'm with Jeronimo. I also thought all of this already had been resolved  China should be the main article of the PRoC. It doesn't matter what they officially call it or want it to be called. English speakers call it China in overwhelming numbers. This is also the conventional short form used by the CIA and the UN and we have decided that that is what we will use for country names here. If we don't stick to that then we are expressly taking sides in political naming issues. The fact that the PRoC is currently trying to dissociate their government from """"China"""" (which seems counter intuitive for a totalitarian regime..) is an interesting thing to mention in the article on the PRoC at China. If we change the name of the article to follow political correctness of the PRoC that is an express act of support for their policy. I for one say we defer such naming matters to higher authorities such as the CIA Factbook, the UN and especially what is most commonly used by English speakers. True they are POV institutions but transcribing what they use is a passive and not express act of POV. Wikipedia is not in the business to decide what the names of nations are  other institutions are far better suited at this highly charged topic. I also think the disclaimer is way too long and bold should be replaced by italics. Any article on the PRoC sho"

The shortest reign is believed to be that of Luis Filipe of Portugal who was assassinated at the same time as his father on 1 February 1908. He could thus be claimed to have been King of Portugal for 20 minutes.[1] However the Portuguese monarchy lacked automatic succession and so any claim that he was de facto king does not hold up to scrutiny.

This appears to be a case where someone has corrected something without realising how dumb it ends up sounding. If I'm reading it correctly it's saying... Luis Filipe was the shortest serving head of state. Actually we kid, he was never the head of state so he can't have been the shortest serving.

Hello David, I and a couple of admins have a sockpuppet theory and  mentioned that you would be the man to discuss this with. Last months both she, I and at least half a dozen other users received from  a barrage of very serious abuse, personal attacks and wrongful claims of wiki rule breaching (so that our talk pages could be covered in pages of WP:NPA WP:Civil and vandalism warnings which according to wiki policy we aren't to remove).  These were all fuelled because of edits to Scientology related articles as he is an admitted scientologist and objects to wikipedia policies regarding POV edits. He was subsequently banned indefinitely. JimmyT claimed to be American. Within days it continued (allbeit in a slightly different and certainly more toned down way) from a new user  - again an admitted scientologist claiming to be from Korea. About 2-3 weeks ago he too was banned indefinitely as it was found he was a sockpuppet of JimmyT. Now, """"coincidently"""" we have another admitted scientologist and """"friend"""" of UNK;  this time claiming to be a Russian based artist who was born in Japan (strange but that's his story) and, again, both wikipediatrix and I (moreso than the the others this time) are finding ourselves targets. Again, more subtle but consistently being hassled about every edit, calling mediation committees, and generally making life difficult. To me it all seems too coincidental - especially as he says he lives in Russia but wrote on my talk page that he is a close friend of UNK's, who was allegdedly Korean. Are you able to assist in an IP search or point me in the right direction? Those editor(s) again:

 Having a Rank, Edits on another page 

I was wondering if you could make me one of the Generals if I do good. It is a rank weaker than the Co-Founder, Co-Ordinator, 2nd In Command and many others that arrive before me. Please let me know.
Also, I have a problem with this Marcus2 in the Powerpuff Girls Talk Page. Not only me but also Rattis1 and probably some other users don't like him because he always delete quite important resources and ones that is known as comments like the Powerpuff Girls won the Friday Premieres or something like that. Please let me know.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 09:00, August 27, 2007 (UTC) 
The """"ranks"""" aren't really indicative of any power and only really serve to indicate who organises the project at the top level, otherwise it's fairly meaningless. You can join but you won't be appointed any title as it's a level playing field here. 

As for the ongoing issue with Talk:The Powerpuff Girls, I've been watching and noticing the edit war you have with  to me and the information about the ratings and demographics could be shortened as the article comes across as fairly one-sided and fanboyish with such info. You need arbitration but moreso need to get a consensus on notability and push the quality up so it can be opined correctly at Peer Review which many CN articles will be undergoing from B-Class down. 

Thanks for your enquiry though, hopefully this helped and if you require more help you can ask User Talk:Yngvarr who has a good record for helpfulness.   talk 

I'll take your words. Since you said that Marcus2 was right about the Cultural References thing, then I'll just let it go if he comes back. Thanks for your assitance Treelo. I'll try my best to make Wikipedia a peaceful place. I learned that I don't really need a rank after all. I should just, like I said, keep Wikipedia peaceful, that's all. Thanks again Treelo, I appreciate your opinion and comments. I'll try my best to completely follow the rules from now on. Alert me if you want to if you noticed me bearking one of the rules again then I'll change that habit As Soon As Possible. Thanks again.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 Can you help me on this, please??? 

Since you're another one of the people who have worked for Iggy Arbuckle's article, I've asked you for help on this matter, along with the others. I'm trying to find out where I can go to ask the administrators for help on uploading images to the article mentioned, but I have had no such luck so far. If you can give me the proper directions, please drop them off at my talkpage. Thank you very much!

Why revert my last edit in the article? It's accordingly to the episode I've seen.

It might seem important to you but read as meaningless cruft to me as it's unlikely anyone would even notice had you not mentioned it.

Proposed Controversy Section

1, I requested administrator assistance because of user mongo's unrelenting deletion of anything I post, including a NPOV Template at the top of the article...he removed it within minutes...the template states it should not be removed until the issues are discussed and resolved.
2, I'm simply proposing a Controversy Section, or any separate section, with the following.
Outside Magazine revealed Kellogg used the """"powerful steroid dexamethasone"""" for an Everest speedclimb attempt.http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/Climbings-Little-Helper.html
The above 'powerful steroid dexamethasone' is in the subtitle of the article, and the paragraph on Kellogg is about 30 paragraphs from the top.
3, I'm open to different wording.
4, Mongo objected to this with various personal objections about the climber.  Mongo did not propose other wording, or any other alternative.  Instead he deleted it within minutes, and did not suggest discussing it, nor would tolerate any discussion.  Isn't this a violation of wikipedia conduct?
5, Fact:  National media Outside Magazine did an article on the matter, it's a critical article, and the journalist did a paragraph on Kellogg's use of the prescription drug on Everest.
I will try to find other mention of Kellogg's use of the drug...there is mention of it at his sponsor's blog Outdoor Research.
6, Administrator, could you inquire into whether other moderators etc are joining together to control the information in the article?
7, Could you ask for a third party to take part?

I dunno. In a completely different sport of American football, would you consider the first winner of the Heisman Trophy, Jay Berwanger, removed from Category:American football running backs for he didn't play football again after he graduated?

Arlok has removed content that does not please his POV citing nonsensical excuses like 'terrorism' and 'Union of India' etc. which is an intolerable behavior here at Wikipedia.

 From WP:ANI 

Hi, all.  Now that I know that this discussion exists, I'd like to contribute.

I'll say three things briefly, then answer any questions.  First, I have no intention of making any phone calls in the future.  Second, I am absolutely certain that my actions in no way threatened the privacy of any editors and therefore was not an example of WP:OUT.  Third, please note the context of this accusation.   

 Ok, here's the context: your supporters feel that the phone call to someone's place of business does not belong in the RFC.  Fine then, based on the section of WP:NPA that I have quoted both in our discussion on my talkpage, and I believe I left it in the RFC, this is an issue that requires immediate intervention - if there is indeed action to be taken.  Indeed, when I became aware of the situation in the RFC, I should have brought it here myself.  You have had about a full day since the end of the interactions on my talkpage to reflect - based on the above, I'm not sure you used the time wisely. (talk→  ←track) 

A couple of weeks ago, I voluntarily revealed the fact that I did this research, while carefully avoiding any revelation of private information.  My motivation was to demonstrate that yet another checkuser conviction was mistaken.
Weeks passes without a whisper, until the now-departed User:Paularblaster digs it up to try to add substance to an unpersuasive RfC/CU that he and Schrandit launched.  There was no haste or cause for it, just an ax to grind.
Now, I said outright that I won't be doing this again, and whether or not you agree with the action, there was never any potential to harm anyone, much less an intent to do so.  All this talk about a """"chilling effect"""" is well-meaning but simply mistaken.  No matter how you add it up, the situation is one that requires calm reflection, not urgent action, because there's a risk of knee-jerk reaction without actually understanding what happened.
Now, I'm going to ask you, Bwilkins, the question you refused to answer before, and which you deleted from your talk page.  Bwilkins, how could my phone call have caused anyone to lose their job?   

(@ CarolineWH) Do you understand why we would be concerned with your off wiki sleuthing, and how that could have a chilling effect?  In other areas it would be bad enough, but considering that you are editing abortion-related articles (some of which likely document the murders or stalking of abortion providers) makes it more so.   

If there was ever any risk of private information being revealed, then I'd agree.  But there wasn't, so no, there is no chilling effect.  As for abortion, it's a red herring, as the two editors I researched had nothing to do with the issue.  I would add that this is not a matter of stalking someone I disagree with, but confirming that they were innocent of sockpuppetry.   

(ec):It was uncalled for sleuthing. You clearly indicate investigating the workplace of either Spotfixer or Phil Specter, even if it eventually didn't turn out to be their workplace. Had it happened to me, I would consider such intrusive investigations into my private life just to one-up me in a content dispute, harassment. Despite saying you won't make such phone calls in the future, I see no indication that you understand how serious and inappropriate it was.  

If I had determined that either of them were Spotfixer, I'd have bit my tongue to protect their privacy and allow RfCU to properly convinct them.  The scenario you described would indeed be chilling, but it has nothing to do with the reality of what I did.  Again, unless you can show how my actions were even potentially harmful, it's hard for me to consider them either serious or inappropriate.  I agreed not to do it again, but that doesn't mean that what I did was wrong.

Prince Andreas is a descendant of Leopold, Duke of Albany, who was Victoria and Albert's fourth son and Edward VII's youngest brother. Thus, he can't be considered as the senior male-line descendant of Victoria and Albert but, through dynastic changes in succession with renounciation of rights to the throne of Coburg by the future Edward VII and the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, he is the current titular Duke and thus is, with no doubt, the head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

The concept of there being a need for a minimum difference in boiling points is erroneous and probably comes from rules of thumb for separating two pure phases in a single distillation using a simple apparatus.  That is, if you can boil off 100% of phase A without boiling off/condensing phase B.  Think back to WWII in Norway, when heavy water was separated from """"normal"""" water by multiple distillation.

Hi, Cirt - I hope you will consider stopping accusing me of bad faith editing. If you have any qualms with particular edits, I'd love to hear what is wrong with them and how my approach can be improved. 

I'd like to direct your attention to two quotes on user pages. The first is from Jimmy Wales:

== You can edit this page! ==

Really, you can! If you would like to, please feel free to do so. Make an edit – or even several! After all, that is what Wikipedia is all about.''

And the second is from Neelix's user page:

Wikipedia is thoroughly, inherently collaborative. In the humanities division of academia, we still hold to the ideal of the lone genius, expecting that each humanities scholar be the sole author of his or her journal articles. In the sciences and social sciences, we expect that there be two or three authors for each journal article. On Wikipedia, every well-developed article has many more than three authors. The result is an ever-increasingly accurate approximation of objectivity. This objectivity is not the pseudo-objectivity that results from ignoring our biases as authors, but is rather the result of diverse perspectives all being covered proportionally through discussion between people who have those diverse perspectives. We write better when we write together.

I think those principles are pretty neat. And I am certain my editing adheres to them. If you'd like to contact me off the site, let me know - I'd be happy to share ways to get in touch."

Hello! 

I am about to start my first article (yay!) and have been a contributor for many years.

I see that you deleted an article about The Sacramento Comedy Spot last year, so I am writing you to inform you that this is the page I am working on. I do not know the content of the previous page, so I do not know the extent of the sources and evidence to show notability. I am confident that this subject is both notable and that I can demonstrate it.

Thoughts?

The editor who fears that the inclusion of facts about Oswald's claim of being made a patsy by the use of fabricated evidence and then being silenced by murder, has received support from another editor by the name of  Mr. Harris. (See, above) Mr. Harris argues the beliefs there was a plot to kill the president, and that Oswald was set up, is similar to believing the earth is flat. 

No Mr. Harris, you are out of step with the modern world. In 1979, a Congressional Committee engaged in a three year study and determined that Kennedy was probably murdered as a result of a conspiracy, and in 2003 only 22% of Americans agree with you. Mr. Harris, you are clinging to the past in the face of overwhelming information to the contrary that is slowly being made public as more and more documents are declassified.  Sometimes one has to question old beliefsnot try to delete facts from books that disprove ones old beliefs. 

Congress enacted federal legislation in 1992 to open up the mass of secret government records about the assassination. The Assassination Records Review Board points out that not many people agree with Mr. Harris:

""""The American public has expressed its dissatisfaction with both the work and the conclusions of the official investigations of the assassination and it was this dissatisfaction that was primarily responsible for Congress' initiative to establish the Assassination Records Review Board (Review Board). Section 3(2) of the JFK Act defines the records of each of these official investigative entities as assassination records. As such, the Review Board worked to review and release all records that these investigative entities used in reaching their conclusions about the assassination.""""

Mr. Harris it won't help you cause to argue that everyone but you is dumb, a """"flat-earth believer"""", or must be sheltered from the facts. Please, just stop deleting facts from the articles. The old viewpoint that you want to believe is in the article. But, you’re not

dear jeff, I had this message removed, it is not an attack but I do want an apology for your behaviour. listen buddy, I don't know what that email you sent me was, but Idon't like that sort of talk coming into my house - you might like to watch """"robo-babes"""" and other """"fleshhoneys"""" doing depraved things and putting opbjects into them, but me and my family certainly don't . Now it so happens that was a SHARED email address - one that all my family use, and the idea that my daughter could have gone onto the email and looked at pictures like that makes me heartily sick. and the fact htat you're some kind of responsible man on the wikipedia. I used to have faith in wikipedia, I used to think it was a useful thing, but to get an email from you, linked to this website, and all the pictures you attached - not to mention the links to all sorts of faces splattered in the worst kind of bodily fluids and excretions... this mighht be your chance to turn the enciclopedia into a den of perversion and pornography. It's not that there were the pictures on here - I can understandf if I wanted to look an article about some kind of deviant practice - but why would you send that to me here? you should be stripped of the medals you have so proudly on your page - in the army we used to have a word for people like you and I wouldn't want to print it here.

It's a little bit hard to dispute the notability of an article for deletion when it gets tagged for speedy deletion within 6 or 7 hours of it's initial posting.

Ethnic Malays
This edit war is getting a little tiring.

Yes, it is true they are similar to """"some degree"""". But you could also say that Malays are similar to """"some degree"""" with many other Austronesian cultures, of which there are thousands. If you look at the language classification  the Malay language and Javanese have over 1000 languages in the same language group. Out of those, the Malay language is in fact closer to many other languages such as Ibanic, Kendayan, Balinese, Madurese & Sundanese than it is to Javanese. So why have you mentioned Javanese specifically and not one of those other 1000 cultures, especially those which are more closely linked to Malay culture? You can of course find elements of one culture which have been adopted by another culture, but does that make them similar enough to mention? Its like saying American and Japanese culture is similar since they both like to play baseball. You could just as correctly say that Malays and Thais are similar """"to some degree"""". The second part of the claim """"however it differs by being more overtly Islamic than the Javanese culture"""" is wrong since it implies that religion is the only, or even the main differentiating factor. This is total nonsense.

 Corrections to discussion about sky glow in LP page and in main sky glow page. 

1. Light is scattered by molecules (Rayleigh scattering) and aerosols - not """"refracted.""""
2. Aerosol scattering dominates in most places - in """"clear ir"""" (see Garstang, 1986, PASP), the total scattering from aerosols is ~10x that from molecules.
3. Aerosol scattering has almost no wavelength dependence, reducing the dominance of blue light influence below that expected from pure Rayleigh scattering and the RSI of Keith.
4. But, the Purkinje effect makes the eye more sensitive to white/blue rich light when dark adapted (most relevant when looking at/adapted to sky glow; only marginally relevant when looking at/adapted to outdoor night lighting levels), increasing again the dominance of white/blue-rich sources.
5. The Bortle scale has made very little or no penetration into professional astronomy - astronomers, when they characterize skyglow at all, still use mag/arcsec2.  Bortle scale is being used by amateurs and is being investigated in some detail by US National Park Service as a useful scale to characterize night sky quality.  Finally, the Bortle scale uses much more than just sky glow to characterize skies.

If you want to use the Krugman link, keep in mind it says Obama is in danger of becoming one, while saying Bush was one. It is also an opinion piece. Depending on how far one wants to stretch the definition of CoP, we could include most of the examples listed above, as well as Reagan and potentially GWB (before his approval ratings tanked). Hell, we could even mention Martin Luther King. But there is an enormous difference between them and Kim Jung Il or Fidel Castro. 

There is no doubt Obama has some over-zealous fans. Many do, including Ron Paul and Sarah Palin, though admittedly some of Obamas are substantially more so. What is useless to the article is anecdotal evidence such as a group of kids singing a song or some guy who made some Obama votives. As for singing, one should keep in mind that for many years candidates would have campaign songs written about them, naming them specifically, so a song about Obama is really nothing new. (Recently the trend has been to adopt pop songs from the 60s and 70s, but that isn't a rule.) Most importantly, he distinction must be made between what happens during a regime and what happens during a campaign. In any presidential campaign emotions are running high, and both sides are actively promoting themselves as much as possible, with signs and images everywhere. Campaigns have become bigger, more expensive, more promotional, and more partisan over the last couple decades. This is not necessarily indicative of the situation when the campaign is over.

105617,"""After reading the info on Rex Humbard, I noticed not ONE SINGLE WORD that would indicate he was anything but a wonderful minister.  Many people, including me, would loudly disagree.  In the 1980's, I personally interviewed a former worker in his computer center in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, and heard about the highly questionable fund-raising methods employed.  That former worker told me that Humbard used """"scare tactics"""" to get viewers, especially elderly viewers, to send in money.  The main ploy was to send out many mass mailings and claim that his program would go off the air unless the viewers sent in a lot of money.  The former computer center employee told me that Humbard told viewers in these mass mailings that """"the government"""" was trying to shut him down.  Also, the former employee told me that the Canadian government was so concerned about the mailings and calls to elderly viewers in Canada that Humbard was banned from mailing any promotion materials to Canada. Humbard's computer system was state-of-the-art, as was his TV studio equipment.  An IBM engineer told me that Humbard had the newest and one of the best IBM mainframe computer systems in Ohio.  A former engineer at WJW TV 8 in Cleveland told me that Humbard had, at least for a few years, the most expensive and sophisticated television production equipment in the Cleveland area.  Again, according to that WJW engineer, Humbard's set-up was as good or better than any of the TV stations in Cleveland.  

My father told me how he would drive from Canton to attend services at the Cathedral of Tomorrow.  He said that an offering would be taken and Humbard would ask people who came the farthest to donate the most.  He told me that there was a massive cross that hung from the ceiling and that it changed color.  Also, he said that the ceiling looked like the ceiling in a planetarium.  The revolving restaurant idea stirred a lot of controversy.  The concrete tower to support the restaurant was over 400 feet tall and the FAA was against the construction due to airline flight paths into Hopkins International airport.  Cuyahoga Falls is fairly close to the airport.  SEE: http://explorer.altopix.com/map/kdaocf/277/311/Rexs_Erection.htm   for a picture of the tower.

Humbard's problems with the I.R.S. included running the Cathedral Buffet restaurant as a Not-For-Profit, even though it obviously wasn't.  Ditto the trouble Humbard got into with the women's underwear factory he bought in Indiana. Humbard sold the Cathedral of Tomorrow to Ernest Angley Ministries and that operation has also had a lot of controversy.

Notability of I Killed The Last
A tag has been placed on I Killed The Last requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Oppose - The current title is overwhelmingly preferred by the policy of using the most common name, and the manual of style specifically encourages editor discretion. The MOS is great for our writing style and when the official or common name might be unknown, but to argue that it should be used to take an official name with a specifically chosen title that is used by the absolutely overwhelming majority of reliable sources, including books, newspapers, and websites, as well as is the generally common name is fairly absurd. Our title guidelines and policies are unfortunately somewhat murky. But, what it comes down to can be gleaned from Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization), which states that """"an adherence to conventions widely used in the genre are critically important to credibility"""". If Billboard is using a style, and Rolling Stone or the New York Times or Spin or just the bulk of reliable sourcing in general largely use the official title, is it really common sense for us to be saying we shouldn't be following the sources here in order to somehow adhere to conventions and gain credibility? Wikipedia is a unique construct in that our work is so clearly tied and based off of reliable sourcing about the subject  making us stand out and go against the grain here just doesn't make much sense.There's also just the general notion (which certainly should not be the deciding factor in finding consensus) that certain lowercase words just look weird in titles. Perhaps this may give some indication as to why """"like"""" and other 3 or more letter words are very often capitalized in composition titles but words like """"a"""", """"to"""", or """"and"""" often aren't.

 All this argument crap. 

In my opinion, 
a) Notability is established in this article in the fact that One Bid is a qualifying game played 6 times a show, every show, 5 days a week, on a highly rated network game show, and has been an element of every version of the show since the original. It would be ideal to have some other citations to show it's been recognized outside of the show itself, but I believe sufficient notability has been met, and the tag needn't be there.

b) Original research. If you are read the tag, it says """"See talk page for details."""" If you are not going to either tag with  or start a talk page section explaining what you believe is original research (or be more specific by tagging only the relevant sections), then I don't believe the tag should stand

c) I think this article does need more citations. I think almost every article on wikipedia needs more citations than are currently there. However, since there isn't even a single  tag on the article, I don't see what specific information is felt to be requiring citation. As I understand it, Wikipedia practice allows primary sources (in this case, the show itself) to act as a source for anything relevant to rules and how the game is played and what happens. So if there are major uncorroborated facts in the article, you ought to tag them specifically to justify a refimprove banner tag

d) The merge discussion seems to have been abandonned. I believe it should be appropriately revived and an actual pro/con vote be taken, or else abandon the merge tag. I see no evidence of support from the discussion linked to in the tag.

This is my opinion as to how the tags should be dealt with. It is not sufficient to just say """"original research exists in this article so I'm going to slap a tag at the top."""" (for example). These tags should be supported by specific explainations or pointers to actual problematic content unless the entire article really needs citing or is original research, which I don't find to be the case here.

 Wondering If You Could Help... 

A couple of months ago, I created a page for the """"Original"""" Clark Sisters, an American close-harmony singing group from the 1930s and '40s, that was fairly well-known at the time.  As an announcer at a Jazz radio station, includng being the host of a """"Trad Jazz"""" show, I have some pretty extensive knowledge of this genre of music.  I properly referenced the article, and provided appropriate links to and from other related pages.  All in all, I think I did a fairly good job, considering it was only my first real page construction.  

So, along comes this editor from the U.K., (""""Seddon""""), and marks the thing for """"speedy deletion"""".  Before I can even find out about it, the page is gone.  Then, when I try to ask him about it by posting on his talk page, he totally ignores me.  In the first place, I can't understand how a U.K. editor is even ALLOWED to edit a piece on U.S. music; secondly, if he is allowed, why is he allowed to place his questionable judgment above mine?  I am hoping that you can help me restore the page, so that I don't have to go to all the trouble of re-creating it, at a loss of several hours of my time.

I'm also wondering about the procedure for filing a complaint against an editor.  It seems to me that his behavior in this matter has not been appropriate, and I wonder if there is any forum that I can take my complaints to?

 Locations 
Thailand.
While Phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in Thailand that includes sex tourism.  Pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism.  I dont know Phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more non-sex tourists so if I were going to identify a place in Thailand if not the world I would mention Pattaya instead and I am tempted to edit.  I hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more """"sex for money"""" going on in Pattaya than Phuket. But for someone considering the phrase """"sex tourism"""" as not necessarily pejorative I have to qualify this conclusion.  
Note that """"bar girls"""" in Thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general Thai population also.  Although I beleive that there are words in Thai for prostitute they mostly (at least the girls) prefer to call themselves """"rented wifes"""" albeit for """"short time"""" rather then """"long time"""".  I therefore need to be qualify my Pattaya versus Phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and  rented wifes particularly of the """"long-term"""" married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the """"wifes"""" direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both.  There is no such thing as a free lunch and """"everybody pays for it"""". 
[Note that I neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist (note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing) and moreover consider them culturally aware (particurlay Thailand wise).  The fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones! One must be aware that labels, concepts, ideas such as """"sex tourism"""" carry suggestions associated with Religion particularly Judeo-Christiam-Islamic (JDI) pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the (Religious) worlds worldviews outside of some tribal, village, usually Buddhist and what I like to call """"Giesha cultures"""": e.g. Japan, Thailand etc, versus """"Virgin cultures"""" typically (JDI) that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. (Note that Thai Society is strangely contradictory in this regard  aren't we all!  but then Thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west.)  Perhaps some historio-religious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also.  I hate value laden western (and Religious) labels that dress themselves up psuedo-scientificly as culturally universal. Exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more """"exploitation"""" going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like Chinese factories where labourers - girls included - work excruciating long hours for a few Yuan or RMB.]

53738,""" and sounding similar to the English word nigger are used without the disparaging connotation the word holds in English. The French cognate , however, commonly used during the colonial period, is similarly considered offensive, whereas  (literally, """"black"""") is the standard word, with the Anglicism black being a common slang term.

Interestingly, in some places these words refer to people with an only slightly darker appearance than those native to Northern Europe, i.e. people who might be said to have a typically Mediterranean, Southern European/Eastern European appearance without any facial or hair-texture characteristics associated with black people. There are also socio-economic reasons behind this as southern Europeans but particularly eastern Europeans are stereotypically deemed more backwards and less well off than their northern European cousins.

Forms ultimately derived from Latin  have been borrowed into various non-Romance languages, and may be used to refer to people without negative connotation; The Hungarian  referred to black Africans without any negative connotations until the 1990s when its meaning changed under English influence. In Latvian, """"nēģeris"""" is still referred to black Africans without any derogatory meaning. The word nigger, typically with the same spelling and more or less similar pronunciation, also appears as a loanword in languages other than English and has the same racist connotations as the English word. In Nazi propaganda, the German compound niggerjazz was used as a derogatory term for jazz music, which Nazi ideology held was a degenerate form of music. In Yiddish, """"shvartzer"""", meaning 'black' is considered offensive while """"neger"""" is the standard word.

Non-human uses
In the past, nigger was sometimes used as a synonym for """"defect"""", deriving from the phrase """"nigger in the woodpile"""", which originally referred to escaping slaves hiding among woodpiles being transported on trains. It came to mean some unseen problem.Definition of nigger in the woodpile For example, the May 1886 issue of Scientific American, page 308 said, """"The consequence of neglect might be that what the workmen call ‘a nigger’ would get into the armature, and burn it so as to destroy its service.""""

The term nigger was used in lumber mills until the mid-point of the 20th century. It refers to a device that turns a log while it is being stripped of its bark. This may be an off-hand reference to the prejudicial use of the word, as until the machine was invented, this was considered a job too dangerous for anyone other than a black man.

Literary uses
Nigger has a long history of controversy in literature. Carl Van Vechten, a white photographer and writer famous as a supporter of the Harlem Renaissance, provoked debate and some protest from the African American community by titling his 1926 novel Nigger Heaven. The controversy centered on the use of the word in the title and fueled the sales of the hit novel. Of the controversy, Langston Hughes wrote:

The poem Little Topsy's SongLittle Topsy's Song: Sung by the Hutchinson family A modern recording. Music by Asa B. Hutchinson(1823–1884), Boston: Oliver Ditson, 1853Little Topsy's Song: Text and Sources Music by Asa Hutchinson and also by Henry Russell (1801–1900) written in about 1845 by Eliza Cook has the first stanza
'Topsy neber was born, / Neber had a moder; / Specks I growed a nigger brat, / Just like any oder.

The famous controversy over Mark Twain's novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), a classic frequently taught in American schools, revolves largely around the novel's 215 uses of the word, often referring to Jim, Huck's raft mate.{{cite web

Hey, I send that comment to Talk:Macedonian Slavs and I was just about to reply to you and to  when I suddenly went offline. As for your request for clearing out your name, I really don't know how to help? I mean, you are obviously in some quarrel with REX, I really don't know how to help there - you should probably both stop it, (regardless who's started it) and try to find a solution according to the NPOV policy. I have already stated my POV on the Arvanites dispute - I might be wrong, but it is probably better for me to stay away from the dispute. I think that REX's current version is quite OK. It includes what the vast majority linguists say: Arvanitika, is a variety of Tosk Albanian, and Arvanites' sensitivity towards the problem: Most Arvanites strongly dislike being called Albanians. I mean, it's not like saying that Arvanites are ethnic Albanians. For example: I cannot dispute the fact that most sources in the past referred to the Macedonian language, as a Bulgarian or a Serbian dialect, despite the fact that I believe that they were seriously wrong, and therefore there is nothing wrong with this sentence: Most sources in the past regarded Macedonian as a subset of the Bulgarian and Serbian language.

As for the block, I think that you're taking it too seriously. I haven't been blocked, but I have been ignored several times by some admins, although I've specifically requested not to be ignored (they could have at least said that: """"I don't want to get involved"""" or smtg like that).

When comparisons of heart rate and life expectancy are adjusted for body weight in mammals, it appears that life span is pre-determined by the basic energetics of living cells. This inverse relationship between heart rate and life expectancy reflects an epiphenomenon in which heart rate is a marker for, or a determinant of, metabolic rate and energetic needs.

The metabolic rate is dependent on the physical activity, which in turn is related to, and likely determined by, heart rate itself. Regression analysis on a logarithmic scale between body mass and metabolic rate among animals yields a straight line with the same slope as that between body mass and heart rate.19 Therefore, there is a close link between temperature, metabolism, and heart rate, and the question is which is the primary control among these parameters? If heart rate determines the metabolic rate, it follows that a relationship between heart rate and life span exists in the entire animal kingdom including man."

Minimal expectations had been placed upon him for the year, and his contributions had been important to the team staying above .500. With his fan popularity growing, he decided to try something that some may call ugly, but others may call the pinnacle of a potential religious or governmental view. As the fans and himself refer to it as, """"the stache"""", it has become an icon for not only [|Giambi], but the entire Yankee team. With other players such as Andy Pettite and Johnny Damon joining [|Giambi] with the facial hair, than shaving away, it was clear that this simple patch of lip fur was here to stay. Despite some claims that """"Just For Men"""" has been involved in the increasing color and thickness of said """"stache"""", there have been no official remarks from [|Giambi]. The infusion of the """"stache"""" into the everyday life of Yankee fans has formed the potential for a governmental ideology, justly named the Giambigarchy. It is a simple view which includes drinking plenty of beer, and growing incredible upper lip fur. A view that may conflict with the current Republican/Democratic debate for the upcoming election, but surely a view that would not start any wars in Iraq, or drive gasoline prices over $4.00/gallon. We of the Giambigarchy way of view encourage you took to take a long look at your own """"stache"""" and ask, """"Do I represent myself the way [|Jason Giambi] and his facial attributes do?"""" That is the only question required for acceptance of the Giambigarchy point of view, and we recommend any fan ask themselves that question. The governmental form under the Giambigarchy is a very open-minded yet structured form that allows for the basic freedoms of its followers, and party members, yet remains an extremely fun-loving and positive outlook on life that other religions, and governments have failed to achieve. The savior [|Jason Giambi] has led by example to bring together his followers, encouraging them to live their lives with what is referred to as """"stassion"""". This is a twist on passion, as of course one must dawn the proverbial mustache. This very close knit, and increasingly popular group has reached a new way of life, and the numbers of proud followers are completely staggering. Established in May of 2008, Giambigarchy registered members have reached to a total of 13,422 (as of July 5th, 2008).

In the post-Reconstruction, pre-WWI United States, the """"N-word"""" was far less transgressive than it is today.
That particular word has undergone such a dramatic reduction in social acceptability that it must be presented within context, if at all.

27103,"""proposal by Coulliard 

I'm going on the soapbox for awhile, an uncomfortable position in a baseball game (sliding runners tend to knock it out from under you).  I want to explain my position without us getting personal.  If you take offense, apologies in advance.  And apologies for being so wordy.  Genetic defect.

I am a baseball researcher by hobby (computer programmer by trade), and I take everything about baseball's history seriously, especially the Negro Leagues, which have become my area of expertise.  Segregation in Baseball remains the absolute worst scar on its face.

In my opinion (emphasis on it being my opinion), Josh Gibson, Pete Hill, Satchel Paige, Bullet Rogan, Oscar Charleston, Andy Cooper, José Méndez, Cristobal Torrienté, and many others men would have easily been Hall of Famers long, long ago had it not been for segregation.  It's my belief that given current evidence Gibson wouldn't have hit much more than 500 or so home runs playing a full schedule, given the HR rates of the 30s and 40s (not nearly as high as today), given his truncated career (he died after his 17th season), and given the position he played (catchers just don't play full schedules because of the extreme wear and tear; on the other hand, he might have been converted into an outfielder or first baseman in an integrated Majors, and 600+ would have been a possibility.

Babe Ruth hit 714 Major League HRs; had he had to face Bullet Rogan, Andy Cooper, Satchel Paige, and other pitchers of color, his totals might have tailed down toward 650 or so, and that in a 22-year career compared to Gibson's 17.

What we know is that Gibson is credited with 115 verifiable HR in Negro League play, plus 44 in Mexican League play, which was a bit lower level competition than MLB.  Gibson hit .359 against Negro League competition, which would be second highest of all time (behind Cobb) had he done so in an integrated majors, and Cobb's .366 might have lost a few points as well had he had to face Negro pitchers like Lefty Cooper and Willie Foster.

The raw numbers are still small.  We can't do anything about that.  115 compares very badly to 714, much less 762.  But it's still important to know those numbers, because it's what he did against major league-level competition.  What he did against amateur and semi-pro competition in exhibition games is fun to know (if we truly did know), but it is not the true measure of his worth, and (IMO) it insults the man's memory to artificially pad his numbers.  Understanding that Babe Ruth hit HIS home runs in a league that played 154 games per season, that homers were easier to hit in Ruth's league than Gibson's (livelier baseballs in the AL), the relative numbers make Gibson look like Ruth's peer.

With few exceptions, there are no researchers who do not believe that Josh Gibson was one of the two or three best pure power hitters in the game, and no exceptions among serious Negro League researchers.  We can (and in fact should) report that there have been various reports of his accomplishments in earlier days, but these numbers, taken without any context present a superman as unbelievable as that X-Files episode (""""The Unnatural"""").

You have to trust that the reason for putting up Gibson's reduced stats has a noble purpose.  Telling people that Gibson hit 800+ HR and batted .384 against all levels of competition tells nothing really, because he could have in reality hit .200 with no HR against top-level Negro League teams, but fattened up by counting 1,000 games against Little League comptetition.  Telling them he hit .359 and had a home run every sixteen at bats in a career that included many games in Griffith Stadium tells them something of importance  it gives us an excellent clue as to how he would have hit in the Majors, had he been allowed to play.

The """"nearly 800"""" and """"962"""" numbers give us no way of being able to separate them and understand their meaning.  An official scorer counted every one of Babe Ruth's HR in his major league career, and we can go back to sources from that day and find it.  In Gibson's case, someone reported (sometimes months later) numbers that no one even at that time could verify, because a lot of the numbers were based on hearsay, and some were just plain made-up.  We can't tell how many he hit over a 150-foot fence against a 17-year-old kid with a 60 MPH fastball, because we can't separate them.

There's plenty of space on the internet for repeating urban legend as fact.  Wikipedia should not be one of them.

My proposal is that we rewrite the article to include the latest official numbers, and make sure it is understood why Gibson only managed to play 510 Negro League games in his career.  It will inclu"

 Also concerning TheCommish21 

First of all, your statement about the Underground Football League was incorrect.  It is not a fantasy football league.  The UFL is a full-contact, tackle football league based in Macungie, PA, that attracts teenagers (ranging from 9th to 12th graders) from all over the Lehigh Valley.  There are referees, statisticians, an official rulebook, and permenant teams.  It is not just a hobby that was created without any sort of solid foundation.  It's website is growing rapidly, with nearly 6000 hits since the beginning of October.  Merely because it is local and young, does not mean that it doesn't hold a solid enough position in the world to have a Wikipedia page.  Your response to the Perl citation was a weak showing of how the UFL did not deserve a page.  Perhaps there are people who are very interested in football.  They might be interested in seeing how leagues in other areas.  If someone has a vested interest in something, they should be allowed to access information about it.  Isn't that what Wikipedia is all about?

 """"Foo people"""" on cat names has two meanings even in indigenous areas 

So, as I've explained countless times, """"FOO people"""" is what Obiwankenobi described as a """"namespace collision"""".

 Babak 

Hi, Parthian Shot. I'm wondering what your objection is to al-Tabari's account of Babak riding to his execution on an elephant and why you say he was betrayed by al-Afshin when al-Afshin was the prominent Abbasid general who defeated Babak? Best Wishes

 Your user page. 

Hello! Welcome to the Wikipedia even if you had a bit of a rocky start, that has happened to most of us.  May I congratulate you on your conduct at the Teahouse, very nicely and gracious done! The page you accidentally wrote your article on is called your user page. It is meant to be used by you and describe your intentions here at the Wikipedia. I have taken the liberty of re-creating it for you:  if you need any help.

Here are some tips on how to make your user page (or you can just click around and look at some other users pages and see how it's done).

For making your user page look nice, see: Wikipedia:User page design center. You can also """"clone/borrow/steal"""" the code from someone else's user page. Just ensure that you change it enough that it does not look like you are trying to impersonate the other user. Wikipedia:User pages is a good guide as to what kind of things are appropriate in user space. And when you use the work someone else has created, in the edit summary please attribute the work to them by naming the user you copied the content from. If you want to add userboxes you can start here: Wikipedia:Userboxes. There are also many, many customized userboxes floating around on user pages in the Wikipedia, if you find one you fancy just copy the code from the page.

Frankly I am less interested than comparisons between coordination between with the list vs watchlist coordination than opaque coordination (list or watchlist) vs transparent collaboration.

I am not suggesting you only present evidence against EE list members.  Or even that it really be focused on individual editors.  What has the existence of a Battleground done to articles in this topic area, is really what I want to know.  While EE editors have apologized for some personal offenses, I believe that none of them have shown understanding that they harmed Wikipedia.  I am probably wrong about none, but I can't recall this.  I can't say that I have even paid much attention to this at the individual editor level.  Except to be honest I feel a bit differently about the admin. Mostly I want support for the argument that the whole Battleground approach is inferior.  Evidence that shows damage done by all parties for what it is would help because the focus on the revelations from the list while ignoring the other half the battleground reinforces their feelings of persecution.  Right now each side exaggerates the damage done by the other and then there is extra evidence against EE from the list.  If we don't convince them that we have a point about condemning this sort of behavior; I don't know that anything Arbcom can do will make an impact.  Arbcom isn't good at convincing.

Hello
Hi Harebag!  Welcome!  When I saw the article on the Pigeon Force Police 
Department, I thought it was a joke.  It is real.  I also started a new article on Larry Buendorf.  He's a secret service agent that wrestled a presidential assassin to the ground.  Any suggestions for improvement, let me know.  As for your article, I suggest a little background.  Mention the city and state name.  Fix the link.  Good Luck on editing!  

Additional suggestions for Pigeon Force PD: Who's the chief? Any major history? Big crime solved? Any controversy or major lawsuit against it? When was it established? Was the area patrolled by the county sheriff before then and then the city was established (if so when?).  These are just tips.  Otherwise, there is a risk that someone will petition for the article's deletion because there is a board for that (thus destroying your hard work).  That's the reason that I wrote quite a bit about my new article first rather than just start out with a few sentences and add to it slowly.  I do plan to add more to my article, though.

Maybe I missed something in your offer to help.  If so, sorry.  Completely reverting all my useful comments based on firsthand knowledge of the diet and its effects on my health did not seem helpful at all, since you decided you knew better.  Do you have any knowledge on this subject?  If so, please inform me.  Do you have cancer?

Also, please explain, for example, why """"proponents"""" of Budwig's diet mention 6 or 7 Nobel Prize nominations when 7 nominations are clearly stated on the book's cover but you reverted this completely to make it sound suspect to another person's account that apparently has none of the doctor's books and is operating from internet anecdotes as valid citations.  The truth is that """"critics"""" (apparently existing mainly on Wikipedia) have issue with the book's statement, yet this fact could not be allowed to stand, even though the un-updated online source was left intact.  This """"Nobel Prize"""" section of the article is actually useless and did not exist in earlier versions; it should be deleted outright.

Finally, please tell me what references you expect to corroborate the minimal extra information I included (they information is contained in the her two primary books: """"Oil-Protein Diet"""" and """"Flax Oil as ..."""").  If you knew anything about the diet, you would find what was reported in this so-called encyclopedic entry embarrassing.  My point was to improve it so that other cancer sufferers would not be mislead into thinking this diet is some half-baked diversion and would seek out the books and learn more.  Please tell me what your objective is and why.

I'm sure you might already know that Wikipedia has a bad reputation when it comes to objectively reporting health information that conflicts with so-called mainstream approaches.  One full-time industry plant who was monitoring/editing Wikipedia articles (like this one) has already been exposed.

In any case, I hope your original offer was actually """"help"""" as you stated and maybe this article can be improved by both of us.  My suspicions were high coming into this proposed revision and when I saw immediate reversions, you can imagine my concern that all I heard was true.

UPDATE

 Current Speculation 

There has been discussion lately about the appropriateness of this section. I will be going out-of-town for the next 5 days, but in my absence I highly encourage the frequent editors of this section to realize the need (and act upon it) to permanently remove this section. Its existence violates:

  NPOV (nuetral point of view)

- No one can truly say how or even if the listed items will affect voters

Types of bias include:

Ethnic or racial bias, including racism, nationalism and regionalism. 
Corporate bias, including advertising, coverage of political campaigns in such a way as to favor corporate interests, and the reporting of issues to favor the interests of the owners of the news media. 
Class bias, including bias favoring one social class and bias ignoring social or class divisions. 
Political bias, including bias in favor of or against a particular political party or candidate. 
Religious bias, including bias in which one religious viewpoint is given preference over others. 
Sensationalism, which is bias in favor of the exceptional over the ordinary. This includes the practice whereby exceptional news may be overemphasized, distorted or fabricated to boost commercial ratings. 
Geographical bias which may for example describe a dispute as it is conducted in one country without knowing that the dispute is framed differently elsewhere. 

The presence of this section is biased on several of the basses listed above

Wikipedia articles are not:

Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a """"sympathetic point of view"""" for every article. 

This article is adversely some ones' political movement.

Please permanently honor my deletion of this section of the article."""

As you say Prisonermonkeys, the intent is to present the information in a way that is representative of the subject manner: in this case Fiennes has consistantly been credited as 'M' in the lead up to Spectre in official Eon releases, it is in keeping with the precadent set by the earlier films in the Bond series and consistant with the film Spectre where he is referred to as 'M' throughout the film (and only refers to himself once as 'Mallory' at the climax.)

44659,"I am moving the list of european supporters to here otherwise her biography page gets clogged up with names of supporters. The only support which matters is next year at election 2012. The experts say that Manipuris are backward and need to be educated about democracy. The arab spring has taught the experts that it is the people who need to educate their political masters on what kind of democracy they want. I hope Manipuris at last take the opportunity to free Sharmila and rid Manipur of the black law next year.

On 28 November 2010, UK Green Party leader and European Parliament member Keith Taylor wrote to the Indian government seeking the release of Sharmila and the repeal of the AFSPA. Her main supporter in the European Union is Sir Graham Watson KB MEP  chair of the India/EU delegation of MEPs. He has consistently made interventions on her behalf most recently to Dr J Bhagwati Indian Ambassador to the EU who responded on 1 July 2011 to his request to respond to the death threats made against Irom Sharmila. Indian Ambassadors reference BRU/AMB/48/2011 Embassy of India, 1050 Brussels. He responds only that he understands that Irom Sharmila is a hunger striker and that the modification of AF(SP)A is under consideration. Previously in April 2011 Sri Graham Watson and the EU delegation had tried to visit Manipur but were not allowed to do so by the Indian Authorities. They visit each year this year they were allowed to visit, Delhi, Patna and Mumbai. Although Keith Taylor did write three letters on one occasion he has never responded to further input. Sri Graham Watson and other members of the EU delegation do always respond to further requests for help. For example a Dutch member of the India EU delegation Peter Van Dalen whose special interest group is Dalit and subaltern groups released this press statement for publication at the gathering at her tenth anniversary of fasting in November 2010  Smt Sharon Bowles MEP sent Sharmila a personal letter of support which is now with Sharmila. She had added her personal regret that Sharmila was not nominated for the Sakharov last year due to insufficient support from other MEPs a nomination requires at least 40 MEP signatories. This year's nominations close on 13 September 2010. Another MEP member of the EU/India Delegation has stated that he does not believe Sharmila will be nominated this year either as very few MEPs know of her or Manipur.

The European MEPs were initially brought in by one of her Western campaigners Nicholas Crawford a philosophy student at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge. He also chairs a small student think tank. The Wilberforce Society. At the annual garden party Mr Crawford gave a speech about Irom Sharmila and the AFSPA in attendance was their patron Lord Wilson, a former head of the civil service, and Sir Christopher Hum, former UK ambassador to China. Before Xmas they hope to have a seminar on India and Human Rights. And plan to visit Manipur and Sharmila next summer. Sharmila has many letters from offices of Western Dignatories including those of HM Queen Elizabeth II, The Duchess of Cornwall, The President of Eire, Tony Blair and most recently the Scottish First Minister and the Mayor of London all stating that they are sorry about her circumstances but are unable to offer her any assistance. But she has always cared more about genuine letters seeking to make connections."

Please READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.   
I get that. But what's the implication? He announced his resignation on February 11, and February 11 was the feast day of saints with loosely-related names, therefore...?  (talk) 06:59, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   
we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs

Wikipedia:WikiProject Succession Box Standardization:  The work of this group is interesting, even though I am not myself drawn to join in at this point.  I did ask the following question in the SBS WikiProject talk/forum ... (in anticipation of something we both might want to tackle in the future?):

Exceptions to standardization?  My guess is that there are some plausible and well-informed reasons for those cases in which standardization is not the best choice.  

My question becomes relevant in that context:  Will someone please give me one example in which an understandable interest in standardization was not sufficient to overcome the reasons for a specific non-standard succession box?  One would hope that there would have been more than one illustrative example ...?  

I understand your question to be, 'Are there examples where the standard succession box is not the best choice.'  There is a long-standing disagreement about which article should be linked to from U.S. representative's boxes (discussion here: Template talk:USRepSuccessionBox) .  For example, should New Hampshire representatives' boxes link to United States Congressional Delegations from New Hampshire or List of United States Representatives from New Hampshire?  I happen to like the former, since all of these articles for all of the states are fully populated.  Another editor very much would like it to be the latter, expecting the articles to become populated once many articles link to them.  If the Template talk:USRepSuccessionBox gets changed, I was contemplating creating an alternate standard for some states, which admittedly wouldn't be ideal. 

Standardization of succession boxes is something we try to do to fit all needs.  Quite often we find exceptions to the rule, but when that occurs, we either bring it up here to discuss, or find some easy and manageable solution that attempts to correct it.  Personally, I have run across numerous templates that are not in this series and cannot easily be corrected to work with it.  In those cases, I try to convert everything I can in the code and leave or customize the rest to work with the format established.  This was everything that has been standardized is standardized, leaving only the code that we currently have no standards for.  As you can tell from the templates page, there are many templates in this series and many that are not.  Some of the members including myself are attempting to remove as many of the older (and often very complex) templates to this simpler format.  However, some templates such as those for the Canadian parliament are not even undergoing review currently until the current problems are resolved due to their advanced codings.

I hope this somewhat answers your question.  Was there anything specific you were wondering about?– ( Talk • Contributions ) 

I must add that I have myself been removing such templates for quite some time, and have adopted a specific format for both Representatives and Senators, samples of which one can find in the succession boxes for the United States Presidents. My versions look essentially the same as the old ones, with some redundant text having been removed. Link modifications can be performed on these newer, simplified templates much easier, as editing a template is a very different thing indeed from simply editing pages. , The Duke of 

Cut me some slack here, please: I'm the one who initially asked about exceptions to standardization, and now I'm going to try to sketch a bit of the rationale behind that query.  In a way, I hesitated to post any question in the first place for fear of arousing anyone's too eager interest  but now I have no choice but to deal with any unanticipated consequences.  

My concern is focused on pre-Meji Japanese history. I'm persuaded that the succession boxes for Emperors of Japan and Japanese era names are fine the way they are  for now; but they could become better, more useful, more focused ....  

In January 2008, I'd like to begin to work with others in a process of possibly improving the format somewhat, but I'm too wrappe"

 YouTube videos are not considered reliable, as anyone can upload a video and make a claim. The Decal is also not a reliable source, since the description itself is not enough, and like YouTube, self-published sources are not considered reliable. For the hacking incident, the only way for it to be mentioned here is through either a reliable source, like a news group, or by the developers itself. I believe the game's developers have a blog, which can be accessed from the site itself, and if one of the developers wrote a blog entry about it (a passing mention is not notable), it can be added. 24Mati 

 Erm, here the blog: http://blog.roblox.com/2012/04/april-1st-site-issue-and-update/ — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
 Alright, thanks for providing it. While the blog does mention the eventual shutdown due to """"site issues"""", I doubt it'll be enough to be added to the article, since one who's new to Roblox and reading the page would believe it was just for routine maintenance, when it was much worse; David Baszucki didn't say exactly what the cause was, which - in the case of the videos - was various hackings, it seems, and you can't add in details that the source doesn't provide. For the most part, if you can find another blog post from the developers, or a reliable source (as I said, a news agency, for example), that actually explains what happens, then it might merit inclusion. 24Mati

 Twitter and Wikia usually are not reliable sources, especially the latter, like Wikipedia. As I had said, if you can find a reliable source, like a news agency, that discusses the hackings in detail, then it might be considered. Blog posts from anyone not affiliated with Roblox, profiles and tweets are not enough. 24Mati

I'm afraid this article still does not meet the Good article criteria, and cannot be passed. The lead section is still too short, there are still lots of very short sections and subsections, indicating a dire need of expansion of content, the history section still largely cuts off with World War II and then goes on to just list county executives, which is already in the government section immediately following it, and the reference citations are not in the proper format. I've left this on hold as long as I could, but the on hold time has clearly elapsed a long time ago, so I have no choice but to fail it at this time.   06:22, 3 March"

 Canadian Football League - nope 
He does not show up on any all time CFL team roster. Same for the Raiders of the NFL. He does have a football card for the 1991 San Antonio Riders, so he probably played for them. 

Controversy flaw
JBL using racial slurs isn't actually controversial. It's part of his gimmick. It shouldn't be part of the controversy section.  

JBL's racial slurs as part of his gimmick are controversial.  Just because they're scripted does not make them non-controversal.  Further, JBL's comments are controversal just as the Cryme Tyme gimick has been controversial, too.

The controversial section needs some cleaning up. Where's the objectivity? Most of it assumes him as racist by making no dissemination between his personal beliefs, and his gimmick.  

mess
i'm gonna clean up the last paragraph in the 2006 section, as it is written with alot of broken english that is difficult to understand.

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile;=THEAPA.jpg appears as red, the photo does not exist on the page 

 Judgment Day 
should it be noted under a trivia uestion that the last 3 years in a row JBL was in a main event match for a world title at Judgement day (04 he faced Eddie Guerrero, 05 he faced John Cena, and in 06 he faced Rey Mysterio)

 Anyone know the date of his WWF debut? 
The best I can find is December 1995 as John Hawk against Savio Vega (http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/95.htm). Is that right.@ 

 Nicknames 
Should a section be added with """"Wrestling God"""" put there? I'm not sure if he's had any other nicknames or if it's notable enough. But it would seem so, other articles (see Triple H) list them.  
I don't think we should. Triple H has had multiple nicknames, 3 of which he still uses. Layfield used only that one, he used it sparingly, he was almost never called """"Wrestling God"""" by other superstars or commentators, and he has not used it in years. ( )

 Powerbomb? 
I've never seen JBL do a powerbomb. Why is it listed? Because it's his finisher in SmackDown! vs. RAW 2007 or what?!  Emilos

Erased. 142.162.194.57  

 In Ring Return 
I think we should call him a SEMI-RETIRED wrestler, as he returned to in-ring competition on Raw last night, and he actually wrestled.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  
He did not wrestle though, he helped beat up Coach and Carlito. The match was just Hornswoggle vs. Coach and Carlito (it was no DQ, thats why the APA could interfere).  Spyke 
WWE.com announced his in-ring return.   

 Return To Active Duty 
It seems we've been entertaining a bit of looking into the crystal ball, here. JBL returns tonight on Smackdown, but until that show airs, it's not official unless it's properly referenced somewhere else (WWE.com or another reliable source).   

 Well this ultimately proved to be false... 
In """"Semi-Retirement / WWE Commentator (2006-2007)""""...

""""Layfield noted in a recent commentary on TheStreet.com that he was retiring from in-ring competition for good...""""

""""A broken back suffered in a match in England, compounded by a herniated and bulged disc, finally made me realize my career as a professional wrestler was over.""""

Yet he returns a year and a half later

Should these comments be retained?

91494,Thought I'd come back and add that some members of minorities are so scared of what can happen to them when facing a majority power that they just go along with majority consensus to avoid personal discomfort. It important to understand this since it helps explain why certain Jews in the concentration camps chose to work with the Nazis. In that case Sluffs Law can take the form: whenever a member of a minority throws Godwin's Law at you then you can assume they have a very deep understanding of what you are talking about but don't wish to be put in the uncomfortable position of taking on a larger and more powerful majority.

Making progress
Adding the links to the PLDD is itself not harmful. Then again, it's not as useful as it could be if you just add a link to the page and leave it at that. First thing you can do is to make people aware of the resource so that they can use it to write articles. WikiProjects are a good place to leave a note. Relevant ones include Wikipedia:WikiProject Middle Ages, Wikipedia:WikiProject Saints, Wikipedia:WikiProject Catholicism and Wikipedia:WikiProject Anglicanism. Most will have a resources page somewhere listing useful books and links, so mentioning PLDD in those would be helpful. If you have a look at the history tabs of the articles on relevant subjects, you can find editors who write about these things and may find them useful. Please don't go mad. A few messages will do: look at who started or expanded the articles rather than people who did spelling corrections or the like.

If you do add PLDD links to a page, and you can see that there's some resistance to that idea, you should probably do a few other things at the same time. Make sure the article has a section on the relevant writings (a bibliography of sorts). Link to the Patrologia Latina article and then you can work in a mention of the PLDD version. If you add a bibliography and the article has footnotes using , include a footnote and use the  or  templates rather than just adding a mention in """"External links"""". Jonas of Orléans is an example where there are mentions of the works in the PLDD, and where adding a footnote saying where to find De cultu imaginum or De Institutione regia would be useful. This would be more work for you, but it would help us and our readers more. I will change Jonas tomorrow to show what I mean and let you know when done. If you have any questions, please let me know. It seems to me that the PLDD is a valuable resource for Wikipedia's editors and readers (or at least those who can read Latin), and it would be regrettable we didn't make as much and as full use of it as possible.

routine notices of the opening or closing of local branches, franchises, or shops,
quotations from an organization's personnel as story sources, or

93476,"Coat of Arms of Vermont 
Hi, I presume your request is related to my assessment of the article for the heraldry and vexillology wikiproject. My reasoning was basically that it was too long to be a stub, and didn't have GA status, which meant it had to be either Start or B class; since it was on the short side I went for Start. Having read it once again I can't immediately think of any content which could be added. This is a problem I have with all coat of arms articles; once you've said what it looks like, when it was first used, who designed it and any possible symbolism, there's really not much else you can say unless the arms are old enough that you can trace the historical development. Having said that, it would possibly be interesting to know why the state has both a seal and a coat of arms.

I would however take issue with your statement Vermont is the only U.S. state to have authentic armorial bearings described in a blazon. First, what do you mean by an authentic coat of arms? Are there states which use fake coats of arms? Also given that the arms are an example of landscape heraldry you might find people arguing whether they are actually 'authentic' arms. Secondly, a blazon is just a written description of a coat of arms; given a picture of a coat of arms someone sufficiently experienced in heraldry can produce a blazon, so there's nothing particularly unique about a coat of arms having a blazon. (In the European tradition it is in fact the blazon that defines the arms rather than the visual representation). Thirdly, if you want to get picky, blazon usually refers to the anglo-french jargon used to describe coats of arms, whereas the blazon of the CoA of Vermont is more like a layman's description, although it does throw in a few heraldic terms (I note that the external link you provide refers to the blazon as 'quasi-heraldic terminology'). Finally Vermont is not the only state which has a blazon enshrined in statute, see Coat of arms of North Dakota for example.

Regarding possible improvements, I would be inclined to add subheadings, e.g. history, blazon,Vermonter's badge. Also, now that you've added a couple of other sources it would probably be good to add citations to indicate which facts come from which source. The external link says that the arms were not defined by statute until 1862, but the article says differently; is the external site wrong? Quoting the statute numbers could possibly be useful. A couple more images could also be good, e.g. of the arms being used today, or historical versions showing the 'considerable liberties taken'."

The Eurasian page lucidly mentions different Asian countries in conjunction to different European countries. The Mestizo page mentions different American countries in conjunction to Spain and Portugal. The mule page mentions: 1. the origin of """"muleatto"""", 2. well, that's pretty much it. Perhaps muleattos should stop calling themselves mules and adopt their proper label: Eurafrican. It would be a step in the right direction. """

 Letters on the Masonic Institution 

By President John Quincy Adams 

Originally Published: 
1847 T. R. Marvin 
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS 

PREFACE 

IT is now twenty years since there sprung up in the United States an earnest and at times a vehement discussion, of the nature and effect of the bond entered into by those citizens who join the society of Free and Accepted Masons. The excitement which arose in consequence of the disclosures then made, had the effect, at least for a time, if not permanently, to check the farther spread of that association. The legislative power of some of the States was invoked, and at last actually interposed, to prevent the administration of extra-judicial oaths, including of course all such as were constantly taken in the Masonic Order. This was the furthest point which the opposition ever reached. It did not succeed in procuring the dissolution of the organization of the Order, or even the repeal of the charters under which it had a recognized existence in the social system. From the moment of the adoption of a penal law, deemed strong enough to meet the most serious of the evils complained of, the apprehension of further danger from Masonry began to subside. At this day, the subject has ceased to be talked of. The attention of men has been gradually diverted to other things, until at last it may be said, that few persons are aware of the fact, provided it be not especially forced upon their notice, that not only Freemasonry continues to exist, but also that other associations partaking of its secret nature, if not of its unjustifiable obligations, not merely live, but greatly flourish in the midst of them.

Without cherishing the remotest desire, even if they could be supposed to entertain the expectation, of reviving an old excitement, they are nevertheless most anxious to put in a permanently accessible shape, some clear and strong exposition of the evil attending similar ties, as that evil was illustrated years ago in an examination of the Freemason's Oath. Such an exposition they knew could be found in the writings of the Honorable John Quincy Adams. But although the various papers in which it was first issued to the public enjoyed an extensive circulation at the period when it was written, and without doubt contributed much to the establishment of an improved state of popular opinion, they are believed never to have been collected together in any one form readily open to the public examination. This great deficiency, it seemed to the gentlemen who have been already alluded to, a desirable object to supply.

Unfortunately, I don't know the literature on this field that well, just the general background. -) So I know how most of the techniques work, who some of the experts are on a couple of the topics, and I can point out if a particular source doesn't seem to understand the science. But I would say that it's too broad a topic (and not enough is known) for it to be covered in the scientific literature as a single unit. 

That said, these reviews might be useful - please let me know if I can explain anything for you. I've just added them to a couple of articles, so you may come across them in Wikipedia as well. -) I can also recommend more sources on any specific topics of interest. 

Gene therapy is the field that's furthest along. Related articles of interest include vectors in gene therapy (aka delivery methods) and genome editing. There are also techniques such as SCNT (where the entire nucleus is replaced - this is how Dolly was cloned), but I hesitate to consider those genetic engineering. 
Another field that comes to mind is regenerative medicine, although that article isn't nearly comprehensive. This (and the related field of tissue engineering) mainly focus on applications such as the growth of organs for transplant, starting from stem cells. However, it doesn't currently use much genetic engineering; the closest it gets is genetic reprogramming (I was extremely surprised to find that article didn't exist; I've just created it.)
As far as I'm aware, the use of genetic engineering to give humans new traits (as opposed to prevention or cures) is mostly speculative, although the techniques should apply in the same way. Synthetic biology is the closest (in that it attempts to devise new traits), but it's still just beginning and is extremely far from any application in humans. I imagine that most of the descriptions of technology will be like this (not yet applicable to humans but could be in the future), other than that which applies to human cells in culture.
The scope of the article is uncertain to me. Most of the sources that use """"human genetic engineering"""" as a viable description discuss ethics rather than science. (Of course, the ethics is important as well, but my familiarity is with the science.) There is a lot of scientific detail that can be discussed, but as I mentioned above, the science itself doesn't usually use such a broad categorization. 
The science is moving quickly. An article written in 2012 may have a significantly different background context from one written in 2011. 
Modification is easiest at the zygote or blastocyst stage. There is a bit of information on how this is done at transgenic mouse. (It's not done in humans, of course.)
There are a lot of people who use language such as """"the next stage in human evolution."""" (This is something I removed from the article.) I think I also saw it in a couple of respectable sources when I was editing this page, but it's at the least imprecise/poor wording and (at least in my opinion) should be attributed if included. It is valid under a broader definition where """"evolution"""" simply means """"change over time,"""" but it implies some mechanism of progress or goal-directedness (""""stages"""") - so it is somewhat misleading when applied to biological evolution, which doesn't have these properties.

 Which page of the book """"A glossary of Historical Linguistics""""? 

That supports your personal opnion that """"MOST LINGUISTS REJECT ALTAIC HYPOTHESIS"""" Which page of the book? I can't find it.

It says....

A hypothesis of distant genetic relationship
taking its name from the Altai mountains of central
Asia; it holds that Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic
(Manchu-Tungusic), together comprising some forty
languages, are genetically related. More extended
versions of the Altaic hypothesis would include Korean
and Japanese, sometimes also Ainu. Various scholars in
the early and mid 1800s proposed classifications that
would group some or all of the ‘Altaic’ languages
together, but typically these were included in larger, more
poorly defined proposed affiliations, such as the now
abandoned Ural-Altaic hypothesis.(p.7)

Now abandoned is Ural-Altaic relation which was replaced with , not Altaic.

Eurasiatic Greenberg’s (2000, 2002) hypothesis of a
distant genetic relationship that would group Indo-
European, Uralic–Yukaghir, Altaic, Korean–Japanese–
Ainu, Nivkh, Chukotian and Eskimo–Aleut as members
of a very large ‘linguistic stock’. While there is considerable
overlap in the putative members of Eurasiatic and
Nostratic there are also significant differences. Eurasiatic
has been sharply criticized and is largely rejected by
specialists (Georg and Vovin 2003, 2005). (p. 58)

Shri Prashant Bhushan was also party to this and the issue has been conclusively settled by the Hon’ble court, vide its judgment on May 23, 2011.
8. CAG Issue
Response
At present the CAG has no authority to audit the accounts of private companies in view of the clear provisions contained under Article 149 of the Constitution of India.
The various provisions of the CAG Act, 1971, clearly set out the duties and powers of the CAG are with respect to audit of accounts of Union States and Government Companies / Corporations. These powers do not extend to private companies.
Subsequent to transfer of management control to discoms in 2002, CAG categorically confirmed stating that from July 1, 2002, discoms are not government companies under Section 617 of the companies Act, 1956.
DERC itself, in its tariff order of 28.05.09, had observed that the private discoms being a company, incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, presently there is no such provision of CAG audit in respect to private companies.

With hindsight I can see it was imperative to sort out both the copyvio and the splintering user-identity questions.Perhaps I should have worded my thanks to NRS less effusively: but when we have all marched together in the ranks, it is hard for me not to feel a pang of regret for an enthusiastic fellow-traveller that has sunk by the wayside, however he may have strayed - and there is little harm in one murmur of thanks in the epilogue to the Dies Irae. If all our faults were painted in our faces, what a sight we'd be!I look forward to seeing your future efforts with pleasure, and take this opportunity to send greetings and to wish you well. There are still a lot of redlinks in that Wagner singers list!! Best wishes,"

If wp defined concepts are to be abandoned then are we not left without a concensus on the very concepts we use to argue with."""

 23)What trust can I have on your oath on Quran ? Otherwise you tell why should I have taken path of taking up the sword.
 24)I do not know that this person (Aurangzeb) is cunning like a fox.Otherwise I would never have come to this place that is Chamkaur (by vacating Anandgarh on the false oaths of Aurangzeb and his men).

Ajax is consistently referred to as the second greatest warrior at Troy, in the Iliad, but this is made somewhat confusing in Book 23.

 Statement 

I was angry at what I consider to be a massive campaign against Ed Poor's RFA. I rarely, if ever, agree with Ed on anything, but I felt the opposes were over the top. My comment about riff-raff is not uncivil. Riff-raff is a child's word, if I wanted to be insulting or uncivil I would have used much harsher words than that, I assure you. Further, I felt that many of the attacks on Ed by the opposers were far worse than that, even the before-refactored comment. I was responding to my believe that Ed Poor needs to be allowed to bring his dissent to the Intelligent Design and Global Warming articles, despite the fact I totally disagree with his viewpoint. Keeping controversial articles free of being walled gardens of woo is a goal that Wikipedia should seek. We cannot allow even the most righteous people WP:OWN whole swaths of subject matter. Not to be pointed, but the greater scientific community was patently wrong on eugenics, the popular bastardization of Darwin's natural selection, at the turn of the 20th century. I've been reading an excellent book, War Against the Weak by Edwin Black, which catalogs just how it was a group of determined American and British scientists popularized this hideous science and even directly inspired the tactics of Hitler. It is a chilling account of what happens when determined scientists insist their viewpoint is the only viewpoint that matters and how uncritical groupthink led to horrendous travesties being perpatrated against our poor and sick at that period of time. My point is that groupthink is bad. Refusing to debate opposing views is bad. Ed brings the necessary questioning which ultimately results in better articles because lazy and poorly sourced material is kept out, while some space is given for the opposing viewpoint. I feel that my fellow colleagues treatment of Ed, based mostly on his behavior on another project - which by the way is admittedly slanted (the """"conserv"""" in CP should have been the hint) - was aweful. My comments were not directed at anyone in particular and were only meant as an attempt to console Ed on his good faith attempt to serve the community again. Please do not wheel war over this block. I will just go do some move to commons until it is resolved satisfactorily. Cheers!   """

[changes]

I am a USPS employee. I am not much of an author, nor am I a WP expert (so this is probably in the wrong place and horridly formatted, feel free to fix it), but there have been a lot of changes since the 'sorting mail' section was written. For one, the MLOCR's have almost been entirely phased out and their function is now done by DIOSS machines, which are similar to DBCS machines but have the ability to perform OCR function, as well as take images and spray ID tags on the back of pieces (for mail with addresses that cannot be read by the OCR software), as well as spray barcodes on the front. Also, the article seems to give no mention of DPS, which is a set of sort programs that take local mail (letters only, although the PO is evaluating machines that will do this with flats) and put it in walking (or driving) order for carriers to deliver. There are also lots of other changes, as well as machinery and equipment about which there probably isnt much public information, including the LCTS, APPS, RCS, FSM-100, and FSM-100-AI. There is also the entire PARS system, which is is quite interesting:

 —Preceding unsigned comment added by 216.46.197.119   

 Sorry not to be of more help, but... 
There's a contradiction between the first section which says the USPS is the third-largest employer and the employment section which claims it's the second-largest.  I don't know which it is, but someone should fix that.

Should be the third largest - behind The Dept of Defense and Walmart.  I have changed that three times - I will NOT do it again.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.3.50.168   

Removal of 'Monopoly' section
While I removed the 'Monopoly' section prior to reading the discussion pages I firmly stand behind its erasure. The word monopoly is not an appropriate word to describe a quasi-government enterprise.  While describing the USPS as a monopoly may be true in the strictest of terms, the context of its usage is clearly biased.  Historically, the term has been used to describe private entities whose capital power has eliminated all useful and healthy competition. Furthermore, the word is charged with political and economic implications inappropriate for an objective article. By extension of the posters logic, the police, fire, military, the ‘Fed’, PBS, NPR, and others are violators of anti-trust laws as well.  While the USPS does not receive funds from public monies, it’s also not – as far as I know – legislated to make a profit.  Making the USPS the first ‘monopoly’ in the history of capitalist economics to ignore profits and losses altogether.
Your understanding of capitalist economics is somewhat incomplete.  Please review anarcho-capitalism, in which the state is viewed as having a monopoly on social services.  

There are no sources that deny that the USPS is a monopoly and numerous sources that say it is. Of course it is. Any good or service that has no competition is by definition a monopoly. The government forbids competition in letter mail by law. Being a monopoly doesn't require that you're violating anti-trust laws. The USPS is what's called a legal monopoly. I'm going to put the section back in.  01:25, 4 Septem"

 Some minor revisions to the 1st paragraph of the """"Definition"""" section. 

An obviously jumbled word somehow crept into the beginning of the 2nd sentence of the paragraph:  """"The formula useoefficients of price elasticity....""""  I put in a proposed revision.  

I also changed """"quantity"""" to """"quantity demanded"""" for the sake of clarity and completeness. It's crucial that the definition be as precise as possible in emphasizing that PED is concerned only with changes in quantity demanded.  (Elasticity is one of the most difficult concepts in micro for most beginning students and for other potential readers/users  WP's """"customers""""; they tend to get confused by the slightest ambiguity about which quantity we mean.  An ounce of emphasis here doesn't preclude such confusion, but it can help avoid a pound of it.)

In addition, I added """"services"""" to the definition as a token reminder that PED, as well as the laws of supply and demand, apply to both goods and services.

The only other noteworthy revision was to the beginning of the last sentence in the first paragraph to place more emphasis on the PED for the most typical types of goods and services.  Although the Giffen and Veblen exceptions are interesting, they are almost negligibly rare anomalies compared to the overwhelming number of typical goods and services governed by the Law of Demand.  (That's why it merits the rare status of a """"Law""""!)  The exceptions deserve discussion eventually (in a later section), but I think this introductory paragraph would be strengthened by giving them only the briefest possible mention in passing here.  Instead, this paragraph should focus attention on the crux of the issue that readers need to remember (the """"take-away""""), namely:  because the demand for most goods and services obeys the Law of Demand, their PED coefficients will always be negative.  

Again, elasticity is one of the most difficult topics at the introductory level of microeconomics.  It doesn't serve this section or the article well to risk distracting students and other readers from the main point too early with such minor exceptions, however interesting they may be to the intellectually curious readers. Once we've made the main point as clear as possible, then devoting some time to the exceptions is much less likely to cause confusion or ambiguity.
  
I have one more suggested revision along this line for the paragraph, and I'll return to it as soon as time permits.

I made a few other copyedits were purely minor, e.g., deleting an occasional unnecessary word to polish the prose just a bit.

 Raiding Or Trading 

Someone put an unsigned comment in my talk page about substituting """"raiding"""" for """"trading.""""

Spanish galleons carrying silver were routinely attacked in the Caribbean and Central America and that is not a Hollywood myth. And when Portugal, 1580 to 1640, was under Spanish rule, Portuguese fortresses in Brazil were frequently attacked by the Dutch. I have a book written by a scholar on the subject documenting such activity, but because it is a bit long, and I do not have much time to put into reading at such lengths, I have been postponing it. The book is not in Amazon, an English translation seems not to exist, and Portuguese booksellers say the book is no longer available for sale.

 Paul Siebert 

This guy's just like a Holocaust denier in the way he masks his revisionism in casual and practical editing.  He recently removed the section by Sascha and commented that it was poorly sourced despite the fact that two of the sources are easily availible online, and another is from a book, which can also be found on Google Books if the page or quote is entered.  He's clearly grasping at straws.

Would anyone have any objections to sending out a mass text to undo his revisionism when he goes on one of his rampages?

  
He was correct. """"Poorly sourced"""" means that the added text was not supported by any sources mentioned in the article. If you want to add something with proper references, go right ahead. And in the future, please refrain from accusing a good editor of something as serious as """"Holocaust denier"""" when you know for a fact this is not true. I highly suggest not attempting some kind of attack on the article either. |  | talk | 

I was the original writer of the section.  I also received the same briefing on Paul Siebert from Alex before registering here.  First, the sources were mentioned in the article, if you're referring to the ones about Neo-Nazi historical revisionism, as I was talking about what Neo-Nazis say, and their revisionism.  Second, Paul Siebert, assuming what Alex told me is true, is a Holocaust denier, as he denied acts of genocide committed against Holocaust victims at the end of the war.  This can be confirmed in Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State and The Fall of Berlin 1945, both of which have been cited here by Alex.

The sculpture is a representation of Muhammad - that does not mean that every detail is historically correct. The picture of Jesus at the head of his article is absolutely not correct in terms of mode of dress or physical appearance, but that does not stop it being a representation of Jesus. Art is not photography, and doesn't have to be accurate in a litteral sense. Yes, he is holding a Koran - not because the Koran existed during his lifetime, but because it's a written record of his sayings. In artistic terms it makes perfect sense as a symbolic representation. This is a decent, respectful image, and was created to honour Muhammad as an important figure in world history.  

>>The picture of Jesus at the head of his article is absolutely not correct in terms of mode of dress or physical appearance, but that does not stop it being a representation of Jesus.
My Response: The question is not stoping the represenataion of Jesus, the question is what makes the sculpture/picture of Jesus to represent there? Answer: The General Associate and mindset of people, that people immediately bring that image in their mind when they hear about Jesus. While this is not the case with Muhammad. There is no general association of any picture with Muhammad nor does anybody in Mainstream think about it.

>>In artistic terms it makes perfect sense as a symbolic representation.
My response: In artistic terms it makes perfect sense as NOT representing Muhammad symbolically. Why? Because I mentioned how many differences are there in the statue with the personality of Muhammad and how many commonalities. Neither that sculpture nor that painting match any characteristic of Muhammad except that both have breard, and there are millions of people with beard in the world. Thats it."
